luscious soft fruits in our gardens, and the health -\npromoting raspberries, blue berries, goji berries and other vitamin -rich berries are way up \non our \u2018must try some day\u2019 list.  \nThese popular berries, however, generally require certain conditions for cultivation, \nwhich make them difficult to grow in our increasingly fickle climate but, whilst most of \nthem are difficult, it doesn\u2019t mean they are impossible.  \nTake raspberries for instance: known as a cool -climate species they have been \nsuccessfully cultivated around Malir (although I have no precise information as to exactly \nwhere and by whom). If this is true, then they can, with care, be grown elsewhere in \nKarachi, too. They do grow \u2014 and produce well \u2014 around Lahore, \nRawalpindi/Islamabad, Peshawar and can be found both in cultivation and growing wild \nin odd spots in the Murree hills and around Nathia Gali. The canes, as the plants are \nknown, are sometimes available in Islamabad and via an internet plant business in \nLahore.  \nGrowing berries is not impossible in our climatic conditions  \nRaspberries (Rubus idaeas) are members of the huge and surprisingly -varied Rosaceae \nfamily to which roses also belong. The berries can be red, yellow or even black. The \nshort -lived canes continually reproduce themselves, so it is important to cut back and \nremove old shoots to prevent congestion and reduce the possibility of fungal diseases \nsuch as mildew. Raspberries like their roots to be cool and moist and their heads in the \nsun although, having said this, they thrive underneath shade netting as long as the \nsides/ends are open to allow a breeze. Soil should be rich in compost/manure with an acid \nto neutral pH value. In hot climates such as ours, laying a thick, moisture retentive, \ncooling mulch is highly recommended.  \nBlueberries (Vaccinium spp) are successfully being grown, on a small scale only so far, \naround Islamabad, Abbotabad, Mardan and other locations where the soil is highly acidic \nor where a specialised, acidic soil which is also very high in natural humus, has been \nprovided. Tall growing blueberry species need moist conditions more than medium and \ndwarf ones. Ordinary tap water kills these plants, as does brackish water or water from an \narea where lime is present. They should only be irrigated with rainwater or naturally \nacidic water and, during the growing season, they become very thirsty plants. I believe \nthat a number of people in and around Lahore are experimenting with blueberry \ncultivation but do not, as yet, know how they are doing. Plants can be purchased in \nspecialist Islamabad and Lahore nurseries over winter months.  \nBlackcurrants (Ribes nigrum): Like their close relatives redcurrants and white currants \n(Ribes sativum), these delicious berries much prefer the cool climate of the Murree Hills, \nthe Northern Areas and the uplands of Azad Kashmir to that of the far hotter and drier \nplains regions of the country.

Simple to grow \u2014 take a cutting, \nstick it in a pot and off it should shoot \u2014 it isn\u2019t fussy about soil or water type, can begin \nfruiting when it is just over a year old and is indigenous in various parts of the country \nfrom the far north right down to the mouth of the Indus delta. Plants shouldn\u2019t be hard to \nfind but ... for some strange reason ... nurseries rarely stock them.  \nBlackberries (Rubus fruticosus) are indigenous right across the northern regions, Murree \nHills and Azad Kashmir, and have/are also successfully cultivated in private gardens \naround Lahore, Rawalpindi, Islamabad and Peshawar. Easily propagated from tip cuttings \nor by pegging growing tips into the ground, blackberries relish humus -rich growing \nconditions and, from flowering to end of fruiting, regular irrigation. A high percentage of \nwild blackberries here, are small and rather \u2018seedy\u2019 unless they are growing adjacent to a \nwater source when they will be large, juicy and luscious. Sun -lovers, they produce much \nhigher crops when grown in full sun than when located in partial shade where they may \nnot crop at all.  \nBlackberry bushes/canes can be extremely invasive so it is best to prune the thorny \nbranches and to restrict growth by pruning back extra long shoots as soon as they appear. \nBlackberries fruit heaviest on growth made the previous year, therefore, when it is time \nfor serious winter pruning, cut out all stems older than one year or older than two years \ndepending on plant vigour.

Many varieties are well adapted \nto growing conditions throughout the state. Blackberries can be grown in the home \ngarden or on a commercial scale.

In fact, there \nare many \u201cpick your own,\u201d farmers market and roadside stand blackberries produced on \nvery small plots. A home garden with two or three shrubs will produce plenty of berries \nfor most families.  \n \nSelecting an Ideal Planting Site  \nBlackberries will grow in most soil types as long as they have good drainage. Lack of \nproper drainage will lead to root death, plant stress and increased susceptibility to insects \nand diseases. If your soil holds water for a long period of time, consider building high \nrows or raised beds.  \nWhile blackberries can grow in almost any soil, the optimal conditions are loam or sandy \nloam soils that are high in organic matter with a pH of 5.5 -6.5. \nFor optimal production and fruit quality, blackberries need regular watering. Installing an \nirrigation system or planting near a water source is essential. Blackberries require 1 to 2 \ninches of water per week.  \nFull sun (a minimum of eight hours of direct sunlight daily) is required for healthy plants \nwith good flowering and fruit production. Shadier locations will produce nice shrubs but \nvery little fruit.  \nPreparing the Soil, Planting and Spacing  \nPrior to planting your blackberry shrubs, clear the site of any weeds. See the weed \nmanagement section on page 6.  \nTake soil samples from your newly cleared ground. Take a sample from the upper 12 \ninches of soil to determine the pH and nutrient availability. Add recommended \namendments based on LSU AgCenter Soil Testing and Plant Analysis Lab soil test results \nand incorporate amendments into the soil prior to planting.  \nIt is best if the soil can be tilled to a depth of 12 to 18 inches prior to planting because \nblackberries have deep roots. Blackberry plants are often planted in a hedge or row \nfashion, spacing the plants 2 to 4 feet apart. Actual spacing is dependent on the chosen \nvariety. If you have more than one row, rows should be spaced about 6 feet apart.  \nBlackberries can be planted in the fall, winter or spring.

Mature plants have netlike veins on their leaves and flowers that \nare usually showy. Broadleaf weeds, as the name implies, have a relatively wide leaf \ncompared with grasses. Some common troublesome broadleaf weeds are morningglory \n(Ipomoea spp.) and pigweed (Amaranthus spp.).  \nGrasses \u2014 Grasses are monocotyledonous plants with one seed leaf and parallel leaf \nveins that lack showy flowers. Some common grassy weeds that infest blackberries are \ncrabgrass (Digitaria sp.), goosegrass (Eleuscine indica) and barnyardgrass (Echinachloa \ncrus-galli).  \nSedges \u2014 Sedges are grasslike plants that are common in blackberry plantings. Sedge \nstems are usually triangular and solid. Many sedges, such as yellow nutsedge (Cyperus \nesculentus) and kyllinga (Kyllinga spp.), prefer moist conditions. However, the most \nproblematic sedge infesting blackberries is purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus), the \nnumber one weed problem in the world.  \nWeed Management Options  \nThe most common method of weed control is hand removal. Mulch can also be used to \nsuppress weeds. Recommended mulch materials include: pine straw, pine bark, leaves or \nweed fabric. Mulches should be applied at least 4 inches thick. If using weed cloth, be \nsure that the blackberry has a large enough opening to send up new primocanes.  \nHerbicides  \nHerbicides can be a very effective tool for managing weeds in blackberries. Herbicides \nare chemicals that kill or injure susceptible plants. There are two basic types of \nherbicides, preemergence and postemergence.  \nPre-emergence Herbicides \u2014 Pre-emergence herbicides kill weeds as they germinate \nprior to their emergence from the soil; therefore, timing the pre -emergence herbicide \napplication before weed seed germination is critical for their success. Oryzalin (Surflan) \nand trifluralin + isoxaben (Snapshot) are examples of pre -emergence herbicides labeled \nfor blackberries. These pre -emergence herbicides can be effective in preventing small -\nseeded broadleaves and annual grasses.  \nPost-emergence Herbicides \u2014 Post-emergence herbicides kill or injure existing weeds. \nGenerally, weeds are more easily controlled shortly after emergence and while actively \ngrowing. Glyphosate is a nonselective herbicide that is an effective control for both \ngrasses and broadleaves. Care should be taken to avoid spraying the canes and foliage.  \nEmerged grasses can be selectively removed without injuring blackberries with over -the-\ntop applications of grass control herbicides, such as sethoxydim, fluazifop, and \nclethodim.

Initial indication of the girdling by the larvae is the wil ting or dying of all foliage \non the primary canes in May or June. Cane tips may form a shepherd\u2019s crook and are \neasily broken at the base by strong winds. To check for infestations, scout fields during \nmid- to late summer for wilting or dying canes. Inspect stressed and wilted plants for \npresence of holes with sawdust at the base of affected canes and for hollow or tunneled \ncanes. Dig out affected canes and roots, and burn them in late fall or early spring. In \naddition, insecticidal sprays, such as permethr in and rotenone, can be used to manage this \npest. During the first year of infestation, apply during mid - to late October to kill larvae \nas they crawl down the canes to overwinter in the crowns. The following spring, apply in \nApril to kill larvae as they become active. Apply a full spray to completely drench plants \nand saturate the soil around the base into the root zone.

Spread the \nberries out in a single layer on paper towels and pat dry.  \n \nBlackberry Cheesecake Squares  \nCrust:  \n\u2022 11 ounces vanilla wafer crumbs  \n\u2022 \u00bd cup pecans  \n\u2022 \u00bd cup butter, melted  \nFilling:  \n\u2022 3 8-ounce packages cream cheese  \n\u2022 1 \u00bd cup pecans  \n\u2022 1 \u00bd cups sugar  \n\u2022 1 \u00bd teaspoons vanilla  \n\u2022 4 eggs  \n\u2022 \u00bd cup sour cream  \nTopping:  \n\u2022 4 cups blackberries  \n\u2022 1 cup sugar", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1742, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1c0eb7a-c2e8-494b-b8cf-3fc7de098abd": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1c0eb7a-c2e8-494b-b8cf-3fc7de098abd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "BlackBerries.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\BlackBerries.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 878754, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "811985ee-5527-48f1-ab40-95a76cb9d952", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "BlackBerries.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\BlackBerries.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 878754, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "054b04a5b9b169d77521fd9b1e11aab9591188cfbdc062afe203c5ed78c04843", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u2022 1 tablespoon cornstarch  \nPreheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  \nDirections for crust: Line a 9 -by-13-inch baking pan with foil and spray with cooking \nspray.

They are fresh \nfruit favorites and desired ingredients in jams, jellies, \nsauces, pies, and wines. Raspberry and blackberry fruits \nare highly nutritious, containing much soluble fiber, \nvitamins, and minerals. The berries also contain high \nlevels of antioxidants and natural substances that are \nanti-carcinogenic (cancer preventing).\nHigh demand and market prices for bramble fruit \nhave stimulated much interest among potential and \nestablished growers. Demand for bramble fruit is high \ndue to its exotic flavor, its nutritive value, and the growing \ninterest in producing yogurt and juice blends. However, \nsupply of fresh market bramble fruits is frequently low \nbecause raspberries and blackberries can be difficult \nto grow and because the fruit is quite perishable. This presents opportunities for marketing and selling berries through a variety of outlets. \nBrambles can be an ideal crop for both large and small \nfarms. Family labor can be employed for many duties on \nsmall plantings, but additional hired help may be required \non large plantings, particularly in the pruning and harvest -\ning seasons. Because bramble production requires a high \ninitial investment and returns are slow at first, long-term \nmanagement of capital is required. However, raspberries \nand blackberries can be sold for a greater price per pound \nthan just about any fruit, and new production techniques \nallow for year-round berry production.\nA bramble grower must consider many factors before \ninvesting in a planting. The bramble operation should be \ncompatible with a grower\u2019s overall operation in relation \nto equipment use, time commitment, and seasonality. For \ninstance, brambles which ripen in late summer may fit in well with an operation which also markets early- to \nmid-summer-ripening vegetables. Other factors include \navailable resources such as land, labor, capital, and man -\nagement skills of the grower.The grower\u2019s ability to produce high-quality fruit and \nrealize a profit while minimizing negative environmental \nimpacts will largely determine the long-term success of a bramble operation. Establishing an accessible market \nfor the extremely perishable bramble fruits is critical. \nWithout a market for high quality fruit there will be \nno profit. Maximizing production skills will also help a grower maximize profit.\nAbout This Guide\nThis guide is intended as a comprehensive resource for \nboth novice and experienced raspberry and blackberry \ngrowers as well as crop advisors and educators. It provides \ninformation on all aspects of raspberry and blackberry \nculture for the midwestern and northeastern United States, \nand eastern Canada. This publication will help raspberry and blackberry growers plan and implement production and marketing decisions. The cultivars mentioned either \nhave performed well in this region or show the most prom -\nise. Pest management chapters emphasize cultural controls, \nsince chemical use is regulated at the state or province level. The sample budgets provided in chapter fourteen are based on 2006 costs. A glossary is included to define terms that might be unfamiliar to readers. Throughout \nthis guide the term \u201cbramble\u201d will be used to refer to both \nraspberries and blackberries when the content applies to \nboth crops. Information on farm food safety practices can \nbe found at www.gaps.cornell.edu.  Help on diagnos -\ning common raspberry and blackberry problems can be found at: www.hort.cornell.edu/diagnostic. \nGetting Started\nGrowing raspberries and blackberries is not easy. To suc -\nceed, you must be a good horticulturist, labor manager, pest \nmanager, and marketer. Below are some questions to con -\nsider before embarking in the bramble business. The infor -\nmation in this guide will help you answer the questions...........\n   Introduc tion 1\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

How do you plan to market the berries? \n(Perhaps the biggest cause of failure among \ngrowers is not planning adequately for marketing the berries.)\n 2. Are your facilities adequate for the type of \nmarketing you plan to do? For example, do you have cooling facilities for wholesaling or a parking area for pick-your-own customers? \n 3. Is the soil in your area appropriate for gr owing \nberries? Can it be amended to support berry production?\n 4. Is the soil sufficiently drained?\n 5. Do you have a large enough water supply for \nirrigation?\n 6. Does your land slope enough to allow for air \n  drainage, but not so much that it is  difficul t to work?\n 7. Do you have sufficient capital resources to \ninvest in berries\u2014about $5,000 per acre for fall raspberries and $7,000 per acre for summer raspberries? (Keep in mind that a return on investment will be many years away.)\n 8. Do you have the personal skills necessary to \nmanage laborers and greet customers?\n 9. Where will you obtain labor during the busy \npicking season?  10. Do you have land for future expansion and \ncrop rotation?\n 11. Is your family willing to commit to berry \nproduction? (Growing brambles may entail foregoing a summer vacation; working during harvest; and, if retailing, opening the farm to the public.)\n 12. Have you checked local ordinances regarding \nzoning, parking, signs, noise, riparian rights, etc., to see if they might conflict with your plans for berry production?\n 13. Are you set up to keep track of input expenses, \npayroll, pesticide applications, employee records, yield records, and perhaps customer mailing lists?\n 14. Have you started a library of resources?\n 15. Are you certified to apply pesticides?\n 16. If retailing, have you evaluated your farm\u2019s \nlocation in relation to population centers, off-road parking, visibility, and competition? Will customers be able to find your farm easily?\n 17. Have you inquired about membership in state \nor province and national grower  organizations\u2014\nfor example, the North American Bramble Growers Association?

Wild brambles occur on five continents \nand are common low-growing shrubs in temperate forests \nand tropic highlands. Some species thrive at cool, high \naltitudes; others grow well in boggy, tundra areas. They \nquickly grow and spread in cleared or disturbed land \nareas. Several hundred species have been identified, but \nonly three to four dozen have edible fruit and only a \nfew of these are important commercially, most notably raspberries and blackberries (figure 1.1).\nRaspberries\nRaspberries have a long history of cultivation and devel -\nopment. According to legend, the raspberry\u2019s scientific \nname, Rubus idaeus,  is derived from Mount Ida in  Turkey . It was there that the Greek gods went berrying and \nreturned with raspberries. \nRaspberries were possibly cultivated by the Romans \nof the fourth century. During the sixteenth century, rasp -\nberry plants were first collected from the woods for use in gardens in Europe. By the early nineteenth century, more than twenty cultivars of red raspberry were grown in England and the U.S. English cultivars exported to \nthe U.S. were subsequently crossed with North American \nseedlings leading to improved cultivars. Red raspber -\nries are currently the most widely grown while black \nraspberries are most popular in certain regions of the \neastern U.S. The progeny of black and red raspberries \nhave purple fruits; these types are popular in eastern \nNorth America. Yellow-fruited raspberries, caused by \na recessive mutation, are also grown on a limited scale for specialty markets.\nPatterns of production in North \nAmerica shifted dramatically in the \nearly 1900s. In 1920, New Y ork State \ngrowers harvested more than ten \nthousand acres of raspberries. Sub -\nsequently, the systemic \u2018mosaic virus \ndisease\u2019 infected most of the planting \nstock, and the raspberry process -\ning industry collapsed in New York. \nThe raspberry processing industry \nredeveloped on the West Coast with \nthe advancement of virus-indexing \nnursery stock, breeding resistance \nto the virus vectors, and the use of mechanical harvesters.\nThe three major raspberry pro -\nduction regions today are (1) Russia, \n(2) Europe (mostly in Poland, Hun -\ngary, Serbia, Germany, and the UK), \nand (3) the Pacific Coast of North \n   1: The Histor y and Biology of Cultivated Raspberries and Blackberries  3CHAPTER ONE\nThe History and Biology of Cultivated \nRaspberries and Blackberries\nFig. 1.1  Relationships between various types of raspberries and blackberries.Erect types\nEastern trailing typesSoutheastern trailing typesWestern trailing typesEvergreen types FAMILY:  Rosaceae\n GENUS:  Rubus\nSUBGENUS:  Ideobatus\n (Raspbe rries)Eubatus\n (Blackberries)\nR. idaeus\n red & yellowR. occidentalis \n black\nR. neglectus\n purple\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

Most culti -\nvated brambles are woody shrubs that have a perennial root system that functions for many years and biennial \nstems (canes) that emerge every year and live for two \ngrowing seasons. Bramble canes may be stiff and upright \n(erect), free-standing with the top portion arched over (semi-erect), or sprawling over the ground (trailing).\nBramble root systems are perennial, fibrous and rela -\ntively shallow. About 70% of the total root weight is in the \ntop ten inches of soil, and an additional 20% in the next ten inches (figure 1.2). Red raspberry roots grow close \nto the surface far from the parent plant while blackberry \nroots tend to remain in the location where the parent \nplant was initially set. Bramble roots are very strong \nsinks for carbon, meaning that much of the sugar and starch produced through photosynthesis is transported to the roots. Once plants are well established, roots are very tolerant to damage through cultivation.\nBramble canes originate from either crown buds or \nadventitious root buds in early spring. Bud break on roots \nis enhanced with chilling. This is why a flush of canes appears in spring, after the root buds have been chilled America (British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon). \nMuch of the fruit produced in these regions is harvested \nmechanically and processed. In eastern North America, \nnearly all the production is for fresh market. Many other \ncountries, such as Chile, New Zealand, and Australia, \nalso have significant production and supply the fresh \nmarket during winter in the northern hemisphere. In both \nEurope and North America, there is limited greenhouse \nraspberry production to supply local markets during \nwinter and spring. High tunnel production of raspberries \nis extensively used in Europe to extend the field season and is becoming common in North America.\nBlackberries\nBlackberries have been collected from the wild for about \ntwo thousand years, ever since the time of the ancient \nGreeks. They were gathered largely from hedgerows in Europe, where they were used for medicinal and other \npurposes until the sixteenth century. The cut leaf, or Ever -\ngreen, blackberry was domesticated in the seventeenth \ncentury. Most of the other cultivars were not commercially \nproduced until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\nIn North America, clearing of forests for agriculture \nprovided the opportunity for native blackberries to spread \nand hybridize. Cultivation of blackberries in America \nbegan sometime between 1850 to 1860. In 1867, eighteen \ncultivars were listed, most of which were native seed -\nlings and selections. By the late nineteenth century, some \nnotable commercial cultivars had been bred or discovered \nby private individuals. Production reached forty thousand \nacres in the U.S. in 1948, mainly in the Southeast.\nToday, the Pacific Coast states are all active blackberry \nand blackberry hybrid producers. The Southeast region is still an important production region. There is active \ninterest in thornless types in the North and much of \nthe East, but fully hardy types have not yet been devel -\noped. There are remarkable increases in production, fruit \nsize, and disease resistance among the newer blackberry cultivars. Some also show improved color stability, flesh and skin firmness, better flavor, longer shelf life, and a primocane-fruiting habit.\nAs with raspberries, tissue culture has greatly improved \nthe blackberry plant supply. The potential for using black -\nberries in juice has not been fully realized, but the demand \nfor fresh and other processed products is strong, especially \nin these times of health and nutrition awareness.\nFig. 1.2  Typical distribution in the soil \nof a raspberry root system.10\" 70%\n10\" 20%\n10\" 6%\n42\" 4%\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

If this \nperiod of chilling temperatures has occurred, the buds \nwill break when growing conditions become favorable in the spring. If chilling is insufficient, buds will remain dormant despite the return of warm weather. Chilling requirements vary considerably among cultivars. Long chilling requirements of some cultivars may limit their production in very warm climates. Conversely, cultivars with short chilling requirements may be injured in cold \nclimates if they begin spring growth during a winter \nwarm spell.\nAfter the buds break in the spring, the lateral shoots \nwill grow, producing both leaves and flowers. The most \nfruitful lateral shoots are those in the middle three-fifths \nof the cane. After fruiting, the entire cane senesces and \ndies. While these second-year canes (floricanes) are \nflowering, first-year canes (primocanes) are growing \nfrom the crown or roots. \nFlowering and Fruit Development\nA typical raspberry flower opens to show five small \nsepals and five small petals, while blackberry petals can \nbe quite large and showy (figure 1.3). Many stamens \nare arranged around a center cluster containing many \nindividual pistils inserted on the receptacle (figure 1.4). \nFor pollination to occur, pollen grains must be transferred \nfrom the stamen (male part) to the pistil (female part) of the flower. Brambles are self-fruitful so pollen need only be transferred within the same flower to result in \nfruit set. Honey bee colonies usually are not required for \nbrambles, because the flowers produce huge quantities of nectar that attract both wild and domesticated bees. \ntFig. 1.4\u0003  \nTypical flower structure of Rubus.\nPetal\nStamen\nPistilSepalover winter. Successive root bud break can occur, but \noften with less vigor after the initial spring flush.\nBramble plants produce new canes (primocanes) every \nyear. Primocanes grow rapidly during spring and early \nsummer. During the summer, axillary buds may break \non primocanes and form lateral shoots, especially in \n primocane-fruiting raspberries and tipped black raspber -\nries and blackberries. Most of these lateral shoots occur on the top one-third of the primocane. In primocane-fruiting types, these lateral shoots will contain flowers that initiate sequentially from the top to the bottom of the cane. If the growing season is sufficiently long, fruit can be harvested from the upper portion of these canes \nin the late summer and through the fall. During late fall, \nthe buds below the primocane-fruiting zone continue \nto differentiate into flower buds, but these buds do not \nnormally grow until after winter. In spring, axillary buds \non the lower portion of the cane flower and produce \na summer crop. Because of this unique growth habit, \n primocane-fruiting types can be managed to produce two \ncrops per year\u2014one in the summer from the floricanes (second-year canes) and the other in the fall from the primocanes. The term \u201ceverbearer\u201d is sometimes used to \ndescribe this type, although this name is not an accurate \ndescription of the growth habit.\nIn floricane-fruiting types, as temperatures drop and \nday lengths shorten in the fall, flower buds begin to \nform in the axils of leaves, but the buds do not break. With the further onset of cold temperatures, canes stop \ngrowing and eventually go into a state of rest called \ndormancy. At this point plants need an extended period \nof time exposed to temperatures between 25\u00b0F and 40\u00b0F \n Fig. 1.3   Thorny blackberry in flower.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

Between 75 and 125 drupelets \ncomprise a mature raspberry (figure \n1.5). Raspberries are thus considered aggregate fruits \nin which each individual drupelet has the same basic \nstructure as a peach, plum, or cherry (botanically these \nlarger fruits are called \u201cdrupes\u201d). Considerable varia -\ntion in fruit size exists, with a range from one to more than ten grams. In the raspberry, the drupelets separate from the receptacle (torus) at harvest, yielding a hollow, \n thimble-shaped fruit, while in black  berrie s the torus \nremains inside the harvested fruit and is eaten along \nwith the true fruit portion. Most raspberry cultivars \nproduce red fruit, but black-,  purple - and yellow-fruited \ncultivars also are grown commercially.\nResponse to Environment\nCold Temperatures\nAlthough a certain numbers of hours at chilling tem-\nperatures (between 40\u00b0F and 25\u00b0F) are required to break \ndormancy of floricane axillary buds, temperatures below \n10\u00b0F can injure the buds of the least hardy cultivars, and \ntemperatures below \u221215\u00b0F can injure the buds of the \nmost hardy cultivars. \nCold-temperature injury occurs when water freezes \nin the plant\u2019s vascular system leading to the buds. When \nthis water freezes, it will expand, which can cause cells \nto rupture. The buds near the tip of the cane are the \nleast hardy and often rise above the protective snow \ncover where they are more susceptible to winter injury than buds lower on the cane. \nWarmer temperatures later in winter can deaccli -\nmate plants and increase their susceptibility to cold \ntemperature. During periods of warm weather, water \ncan begin to move back into the vascular system of a \nplant as it prepares for spring growth. A significant and sudden drop in temperatures can freeze this water and \nrupture cells, resulting in plant injury. Consequently, cold-  temperature injury can occur \neven when plants have been exposed \nto a mild winter. Fluctuating tem -\nperatures in early spring are very \ndetrimental to bramble plants.\nSymptoms of cold-temperature \ninjury may not be visible until the \nweather warms in late spring and the \nshoot\u2019s demand for water increases. \nThe injured vascular system may not \nbe able to provide sufficient water during this period of high demand, and buds or the entire shoot can collapse. However, new primocanes emerge and grow with vigor \nas underground buds are usually not injured by cold \ntemperatures (figure 1.6).\nWarm Temperatures\nWarm temperatures can be as detrimental to bramble \nplants as cold temperatures, although the effects are \nmore subtle.

Several studies have found that the opti -\nmal temperature for raspberry growth is 70\u00b0F and that \ntemperatures higher than 80\u00b0F suppress growth. In the \nsummer, raspberry photosynthesis may be suppressed \nin mid-day if temperatures are too hot. The plant then \ncannot take advantage of the available light, and growth \nwill suffer. The best yields occur under sunny, cool sum-\nmer conditions. Areas of the world exhibiting the highest \nraspberry yields (Washington State, British Columbia, \nparts of Chile, northern Europe) have relatively cool \nsummers and mild winters. Blackberries are more tolerant \nto warm summer temperatures than raspberries.\nLight\nThe most important environmental factor influencing \nphotosynthesis, growth, and yield is the number of leaves \nintercepting a high level of light. Yields around the \nworld are highly correlated with ambient light levels \nwhen all other conditions are similar. Although the total \namount of incident light is beyond a grower\u2019s control, \nthe amount of light intercepted in a planting can be \nmanipulated through site selection, planting design, \ntrellising, and pruning.\nThe slope of the land and the direction that it faces can \nhave a dramatic effect on incident light, \nparticularly in more northern locations. \nSteep north-facing slopes receive far \nless light than south-facing slopes, and \nyields on steep north-facing slopes will \nbe less, all else being equal.\nFrom mid-latitudes to the trop -\nics, a north-south row orientation will \nintercept more light than east-west \nrows during summer. Furthermore, a \nhigher number of narrow rows will \nintercept more light than fewer wider \nrows. In some situations, growers can -\nnot tighten rows as much as they might \nlike because of equipment such as trac -\ntors and mowers that must navigate \ndown the alleyways. In these situations, \nspreading the canes into a V-shape \nwill improve light interception in the \ncanopy and increase the productivity of \nlower laterals. Spreading the canes has \nother advantages, such as improving spray coverage of floricanes and making hand picking \neasier, because interference with primocanes is reduced.\nWhen primocanes become too tall or dense they \ninterfere with the light interception of floricanes, reducing \nthe current year\u2019s crop. Carbon acquired by primocanes \ndoes not move readily into floricanes, so even though total \nlight interception might be greater in a dense planting, \nthe primocanes intercept much of the light and leave \ntoo little for floricanes. By regulating cane numbers and height through pruning, a balance between primocane and floricane light interception can be obtained. There \nis no single rule for pruning raspberries; the optimal \nsystem will depend on the length of the growing season, \nthe inherent vigor of the site, the variety, the trellising system, cultural practices, and other factors (see \u201cTrel -\nlising and Pruning,\u201d chapter five).\nWater and Rain\nIt is rare to see a raspberry planting wilt from drought in \nthe Northeast or Midwest. A well-established bramble root system is relatively large and capable of serving as a significant sink for moisture.

Insufficient water is first expressed as small berry \nsize, followed by reduced plant growth and primocane production, leaf drop, and then wilting. So for optimal fruit production, the planting site must have access to an ample supply of high-quality water and an efficient irrigation system.\nThough adequate water is essential, brambles are par -\nticularly sensitive to excessively wet soil conditions. Even \ntemporarily water-saturated soil conditions can cause \nserious problems, including poor cane growth, increased \nincidence of soil-borne diseases, and plant death. Choose \na site with good soil drainage for bramble production. Installing subsoil drainage can help alleviate problems with excess water as can planting on raised beds.\nRaspberry fruit are particularly sensitive to rain. Water \non flowers or fruit for an extended period will allow for the development of mold and reduce fruit quality sig -\nnificantly. Rain shelters and high tunnels are increasingly \nused to prevent moisture damage to fruit.\nWind\nThe tall, thin canes of a bramble plant are prone to wind \ndamage. Canes that are exposed to persistent wind are \nsignificantly shorter and less productive than canes in protected sites. Trellises can relieve some of the stress and \ncane breakage caused by wind. Winds can be reduced \nby the planting of windbreaks around a field, usually \nconsisting of fast-growing conifer trees, such as pines or \nfirs or by erecting wind fences. Contact your local Farm \nServices Agency regarding programs that encourage the \nplanting of windbreaks.\nChemical and Nutritional \nComposition of Bramble Fruits\nThe main constituent of raspberry and blackberry fruit is \nwater (85\u201390%). Of the remaining solids, about 9% are \nsoluble and the rest insoluble. In red raspberries, about \n0.1\u20131.0% of the soluble fraction consists of pectins. Sugars \nsuch as glucose and fructose compose the major soluble \ncomponent of the juice. A typical ripe fruit contains 5\u20136% \nsugar. Citric acid is the second largest component of the soluble fraction. Values are similar for blackberries. \nThe balance between the sugars and acids is important \nfor consumer acceptance. A fruit with a low sugar-to-acid ratio will taste tart; one with a high ratio will taste \nbland. Fruits with high sugar and high acid generally \ntaste best. Fruits grown in warm, dry summers (daytime temperatures near 77\u00b0F, or 25\u00b0C) are sweeter, less acid, more aromatic, and more highly colored. Hot weather \n( temperatures greater than 86\u00b0F, or 30\u00b0C) will reduce \nFig. 1.8  Wind fence around a raspberry field.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

Stony soils \nare hard on equipment and difficult to \nplant in and cultivate.\nBrambles should not be grown where \ntomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, or straw -\nberries have been grown during the previ -\nous four to five years. Following corn with \nraspberries can be a good rotation if cer -\ntain herbicides with long residual activity, \nsuch as atrazine, were not recently used \non the corn. Be cautious about following \nfield crops with raspberries unless the full \nherbicide history is known.\nAvoid steep slopes (greater than 5%) as they are vul -\nnerable to erosion, challenging to cultivate, and difficult \nto irrigate uniformly. Moderate slopes (3 to 5%) allow \nair to drain, consequently reducing the high humidity \naround the canes that could promote disease develop-\nment and reducing the risk of cold temperature injury. \nSouth-facing slopes tend to increase the risk of frost \ninjury in spring because plants generally bloom earlier, \nand west-facing slopes present the greatest risk for winter \ninjury because plants are exposed to persistent, desiccat -\ning winds in winter.\nViruses are transmitted among wild and cultivated \nplants by aphids, thrips, whiteflies, and nematodes. To minimize the chance of viral infections, new brambles \nshould be planted as far as possible from other brambles, \nwild or cultivated. If feasible, all wild brambles within \nsix hundred feet of a proposed planting should be totally \nremoved. Sites infested with nematodes should also be \navoided, or nematode populations eliminated through \nfumigation or cover-cropping (more details on nematode \nmanagement follow later in this chapter).Site Preparation\nWeeds\nA major step in site preparation is eliminating perennial \nweeds. This is very important because few herbicides \nare labeled for use in brambles. The herbicides that are \nlabeled have a limited effect on perennial weeds. Too often \ngrowers plant directly into a site where perennial weeds \nwere not eliminated the previous year, and then spend \nthe next several years trying to find the right combination \nof herbicides to eradicate the weeds. It is much easier to \neliminate weeds the year before planting than after plant -\ning. A grower that plans ahead and starts site preparation \ntwo or three years in advance will be rewarded in future production. Weeds can easily cause more economic loss than diseases and insects combined.\nCrop rotation, coupled with a broad-spectrum post -\nemergent non-residual herbicide the summer before plant -\ning, can be an effective approach to eliminating weeds. \nCover cropping the site again after applying herbicide will \nfurther suppress weed growth while building soil organic \nmatter. Repeated cultivation or covering a site with black \nplastic for several months also can be effective.\nFumigation can reduce the weed seed bank prior to \nplanting, but this option is expensive. Fumigation as an \noption is becoming limited due to growing environmental \nconcerns and availability. If fumigation is used, soil should \nbe friable, warm (greater than 50\u00b0F), and devoid of decom -\nposing plant material. The best time to fumigate a field is late summer or early fall of the year prior to planting.\nSee chapter ten for more details on weed management.Fig. 2.2  Sandy loam soil.\nChecklist for a Good Site \n\u2751 a location close to market\n\u2751 good soils\n\u2751 good soil drainage\n\u2751 a moderate slope (3 to 5%)\n\u2751 a source of high-quality water nearby\n\u2751 no wild brambles in the immediate area\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

Moreover, finely ground \nlime is more difficult to apply than coarse  particles, but \nit changes the soil pH more quickly.\nCertain nutrients, like phosphorus and potassium, \nare relatively insoluble in water and move very slowly \nthrough the soil. It is important that preplant soil samples \nbe taken and the fertility recommendations followed to \nensure adequate levels of phosphorous and potassium \nin the crop root zone. After the crop is established it is \nalmost impossible to apply these nutrients and get them \nmixed throughout the soil profile.\nAnimal manures and legumes offer a good source of \nslowly released nitrogen.

Collect 6-inch soil \ncores from at least ten to twelve locations in a V-shaped \npattern within the field (figure 2.3), and mix them together \nto get a composite sample for sending to the lab. Taking a \nrepresentative soil sample is  crucia l to get an accurate soil \nanalysis. After testing, plow the site, add the amount of \nnutrients recommended by the soil-testing laboratory, and \nthen incorporate the fertilizer. Soil-testing procedures are \nnot standardized between states and provinces. Follow the \nrecommendations from the laboratory where the samples \nwere analyzed. Do not use test results from one laboratory \nand sufficiency ranges from another unless you know that \nthe laboratory methods and extractants are the same.\nIf soil test results indicate that the soil pH is below \nthe optimal pH range of 6.0 to 6.5, apply an acid neu -\ntralizer such as calcite or dolomite lime to increase soil \npH one year before planting. Do not wait until after \nplanting to make a pH adjustment because it will be \ndifficult to incorporate lime at that time. If the soil pH \nis above 7.0 it will require sulfur to effectively reduce \nthe pH to the ideal range for brambles. \nAcid neutralizing agents differ from one another \nin two important ways, both of which will influence \ntheir effectiveness: (1) chemical composition, which \naffects acid-neutralizing potential and fertilizer value, \nand (2) particle size, which determines liming efficiency \nand ease of application.

Unless the soil and site are prone to \nerosion, crops with low nitrogen content (grains and \ngrasses) should be plowed under early in the fall to allow \nenough time for decomposition. Legumes contain more \nnitrogen and decompose quickly, so they can be turned \nunder within a month of planting. However, legumes \nharbor several pests and may not be the best cover crop choice immediately before bramble establishment.

This method could reduce the \nneed for herbicides.\nMany plant species are suitable as preplant cover crops, \nand each has its own advantages. In some cases, mixtures of \ncrops are used to realize multiple benefits. Listed below and \nin table 2.1, page 14, are some cover crops that perform well \nin cooler climates; the list is by no means comprehensive.\nGrasses\nGrasses have fine, fibrous root systems that are well suited \nto holding soil in place and improving soil structure. \nSuitable grass species for cover crops are inexpensive, \nfast growing, and relatively easy to kill\u2014chemically, \nmechanically or by winter weather. Grasses do not fix any nitrogen out of the atmosphere, but they can accu -\nmulate large quantities from the soil.Spring cereals\nOats and barley are commonly used as green manure \nand cover crops. Stands seeded between mid-August to \nmid-September will have 8\u201316 inches or 20\u201340  cm of \ngrowth by freeze-up. While seeding can be done outside \nthis time frame, heat and lack of moisture in the summer \nmay interfere with germination. The stand is generally killed by late, hard frosts.\nSeeding rate: 90 to 115 lbs/A or 100 to 125 kg per ha\nCautions: Early seeding may result in considerable \ngrowth by freeze-up. This can form a mat of dead residue \nif left untilled. In the spring, this can keep soil cold and wet, interfering with spring tillage.\nAnnual Ryegrass\nDirect seed in spring or late summer. Late summer seed -\nings are more successful when made from early August to early September. Heavy root growth and rapid seed -\ning development make annual ryegrass a very desirable green manure cover crop in areas when good soil-water relations can be maintained.\nSeeding rate: 9 to 16 lbs/A or 10 to 18 kg per ha\nCautions: Establishment and growth of ryegrasses can \nbe poor during very hot, dry weather. It can be difficult \nto kill overwintering ryegrass with only cultivation or \ndiscing. The nitrogen tied up in ryegrass releases more slowly than from other cover crops.\nWinter wheat\nWinter wheat can be seeded in late August through \nOctober. It can be seeded outside this time but, similar \nto spring cereals, weather conditions may reduce top \ngrowth. Wheat survives overwinter and begins  growing \nin April. The stand can be killed through tillage or her -\nbicide application.

Legumes\nLegume cover crops can fix nitrogen from the air, supply -\ning nitrogen to the succeeding crop as well as protecting \nthe soil from erosion and adding organic matter. The \namount of nitrogen fixed varies between species, although \ngenerally, more top growth equals more nitrogen fixed. Nitrogen release from legumes varies from less than 40 lbs/A or 45 kg/ha in poor stands of red clover to more than 90lbs/A or 100 kg/ha with alfalfa plowdown. \nSome legume species like alfalfa and sweet clover \nhave aggressive tap roots that can break up subsoil com -\npaction, but this requires more than one year\u2019s growth to happen. \nCautions: Legumes are not commonly grown between \nbramble rows because they provide an inconsistent and \nseason-long release of nitrogen. Too much nitrogen at the \nwrong time can interfere with fruit quality and winter \nhardiness of canes. Legumes are also attractive to tarnished \nplant bugs and most are excellent hosts for nematodes. \nNon-legume broadleaves\nThese broadleaf crops may have a role as green manure crops and in providing different plant species and root systems for soil building. They cannot fix nitrogen out \nof the air, but they can absorb large quantities from \nthe soil. Most of these crops are not winter-hardy, so \nadditional control measures are not normally required. Do not allow them to go to seed, as the volunteer seed can become a significant weed problem. \nBuckwheat\nAs a cover crop, buckwheat is most commonly seeded in \nmid-to-late June through to August.

They are commonly seeded in August or early September. Unaffected by early frosts, \nthey can grow to a height of 20 inches or 50 cm by \nOctober. The plant has a thick, short taproot, varying \nbetween carrot and turnip shaped, depending on the \nspecies. Most brassicas used as cover crops are killed by severe frosts in late fall or during the winter. Brassicas \nprovide rapid soil cover and good erosion protection over \nwinter. It returns moderate amounts of organic matter to the soil. For good growth, this cover crop must have \na large amount of available nitrogen. Some brassicas can \nhelp to reduce plant parasitic nematode soil populations \nbelow economic thresholds. The nematode-suppressing \ncultivars of oilseed radish and certain mustards must \nbe incorporated into the soil as a \u201cgreen manure\u201d crop before they will release isothiocyanate into the soil that is toxic to plant parasitic nematodes.\nSeeding rate varies with species: mustard 5 to 6 lbs/A \nor 6 to 7 kg/ha, oilseed radish 9 to 14 lbs/A or 10 to 15 kg/ha \nCautions: Growth will be poor if soil nitrogen levels are low or if soil compaction is severe. Scattered volunteer \nplants may appear in crops previously planted to brassicas. \nSome varieties may have a greater tendency to survive \nwinter conditions and germinate the following year. More \nthan one  year of a nematode-suppressing cover crop may \nbe required to successfully reduce nematode populations.\nMarigolds\nMarigolds are used as a preplant cover crop in parts of \nNorthern Europe and to some extent in North America. \nThey can be a useful cover crop for nematode suppres -\nsion. Certain cultivars of African marigolds produce a \nroot exudate that kills nematodes in the soil directly. \nResearch has suggested nematode suppression from \nthese cultivars can be achieved for up to two  years.  Shal -\nlowly seed marigolds (no more than a \u00bd-inch depth) in \nthe spring once soils have warmed (soil is more than 65\u00b0F). Achieving a dense weed-free stand is essential \nfor nematode suppression. Use of the stale seedbed \ntechnique for weed control has been successful. Light \nirrigation may promote more consistent germination. \nPlants do not have to flower to provide benefits, and \nthey can be plowed under after growing for ninety \ndays or more.\nSeeding rate: 1.1 lbs/A or 1.3 kg/ha\nCautions: Seeding of marigold is difficult as the seed \ntends to bridge in the drill tubes.

A grower can harvest berries continuously from the beginning of the raspberry season in early summer to the first fall frost by selecting early-, mid-, and late-\nripening floricane-fruiting cultivars for summer fruit, \nfollowed by primocane-fruiting cultivars for fall fruit. A grower more interested in a concentrated harvest season \ncould plant cultivars with similar ripening periods.\nDisease resistance is an important factor in cultivar \nselection. Phytophthora root rot ( Phytophthora spp.), a \nroot rot fungus, is prevalent in many soils, especially \nthose that hold water because of poor drainage. Plant resistance is the primary method to combat this disease. When choosing bramble cultivars, give priority to cul -\ntivars resistant to Phytophthora root rot if you will be planting into a field that has poor drainage or is known \nto be infested. Planting exclusively nonresistant cultivars \ncould lead to total crop failure, especially during a wet \nyear. Blackberries and black raspberries are less susceptible \nthan many red and purple raspberry cultivars.\nThe productivity of individual cultivars varies depend -\ning on soil type, fertilization, weather, and season. For \nexample, some cultivars are more tolerant of wet soils, \nwhile others grow well only in light soils. In all cases, \nconsider where each cultivar has been developed and how \nextensively it has been tested prior to release. Plant several \ncultivars to stretch out the marketing season and reduce the risk of loss to one specific disease or pest problem.\nEvaluate the performance of new cultivars in small \ntest plantings before placing large orders for plants. \nProgressive growers provide samples of new cultivars \nto customers for feedback. While a berry may perform well for the grower, customers may not like the flavor. Ultimately, it is the superior flavor of berries that moti-vates the consumer to buy.\nOrder plants from a nursery that offers certified virus-\nindexed material; this indicates that plants have tested \nnegative for common viruses that may decrease productiv -\nity. Certified virus-indexed plants have the best growth \nand productivity and will generally live longer and be \nmore profitable. Propagation from fruiting fields is not \nrecommended because the disease status of the plants \nwill be unknown.\n   3: Plant Sel ection  17Plant Selection\nFig. 3.1  Fruit of Titan summer-fruiting red raspberry.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

Brambles can \nbe propagated using root cuttings, \nbut this is not a common method \nof propagation in eastern North \nAmerica.\nBare root dormant suckers are \nrooted canes or \u201chandles\u201d with one \nseason of growth that were dug after \nbecoming dormant in the fall (fig -\nure 3.3). These conventional trans -\nplant types for red raspberries and \nblackberries are stored until spring \nshipping. They can tolerate rough \nhandling and can be planted before \nthe danger of frost is over. However, \nthey are large and cannot be put through most transplant -\ners, and their roots cannot be allowed to dry out.\nBlack raspberry plants are traditionally propagated \nusing a tip-layering method. Tip-layered canes are pro -\nduced when the growing tips of canes are covered with \nsoil in summer, causing them to root. The new plants are separated from the cane following dormancy, are stored until shipping, and are handled like bare root suckers. \nTissue-cultured plants (figure 3.4) grow more rapidly \nand uniformly in the field than conventionally propagated \ntransplants and generally produce higher yields early in \nthe life of the planting. However, tissue-  cultured trans -\nplants are more costly to produce and \npurchase. Tissue culture is a means \nof producing whole plants from \npieces of plant tissue.  Tissue - cultur ed \nplants originate in a lab when the \n growing tips of virus-indexed plants \nare removed under sterile laboratory \nconditions and placed in a growth \nchamber on a specialized medium. \nThe growing tips receive several \ntreatments that cause them to form plantlets. The plantlets are placed in \nsterile rooting media and grown in \nthe greenhouse. The small  tissue -cul-\ntured plants are then sold in \u201cspeed -\nling\u201d-type transplant trays either as actively growing or dormant plants. This plant type is sensitive to herbi -\ncides for several months after plant -\ning and non-  dorman t plants must be \nset after the danger of frost is over.Fig. 3.2  Types of bramble propagules: \nA bare root, B tip-layering, and C tissue-cultured.\nFig. 3.3  Bare root dormant suckers.\nA B C\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

By selecting an early-\nripening, a mid-season and a late-  season  floricane-fruiting \ncultivar, and a primocane-fruiting cultivar, a grower can \nharvest berries continuously from early summer through \nthe first fall frost. Bramble plants are adaptable to a variety \nof production systems besides field production, including \nhigh tunnels and greenhouse production, allowing the \nharvest season to be extended nearly year-round. These protected systems offer potential increases in yield and fruit quality as compared to field production, but they \nrequire significantly more investment in technology and \noperating capital. High-tunnel and greenhouse systems are of particular value where a premium market exists for high-quality fruit produced with little or no pesti -\ncide use. \nWhich type of bramble and production systems you \nshould choose depends on the time of year you wish to produce berries, the quality of the market in your area \n(are consumers willing to pay top dollar for high-quality, \noff-season produce?), and your aversion to risk. Field Production\nLayout\nCommercial field plantings of brambles are set out in \nrows for ease of management and maximum production. \nNarrow row widths and closely spaced rows produce the \nhighest yield. Before deciding on a row orientation, grow -\ners should take into account slope, soil erosion potential, \nwind movement, soil drainage, and sunlight interception. \nNorth-south rows intercept sunlight more evenly than east-west rows; hence sunscald is less problematic, and \nfruit ripens more evenly. Rows that run with the wind \nwill dry more quickly than those that block the wind. \nThe best orientation for each site will vary. For example, a grower on a breezy site with winds from the west may \ndecide to orient the rows east-west, while a grower on \na site that is mostly calm is likely to find north-south \nrows preferable. In heavy soils or wet sites, use raised \nbeds that are 10 to 12 inches high at the peak and 4 \nto 6 feet wide at the base (figure 4.1).

In greenhouses \nand high tunnels where equipment (e.g. a mower) does \nnot have to move down the row, rows can be as close as 6 \nfeet. This is not a recommended spacing for field plantings.\nRed raspberries are typically planted 2 to 3 feet apart \nwithin the row. Red raspberry cultivars tend to produce \nmany suckers (new shoots originating from root buds) \nand will form a fairly uniform hedgerow of canes within \ntwo years of planting. Cultivars that do not produce \nmany suckers, such as Titan and most yellow raspberries, \nshould be planted 2 feet apart, while vigorous cultivars, such as Boyne, can be set up to 4 feet apart.\nBlack raspberry plants do not spread far from the \noriginal plant, and hence do not fill in the row in the same \nmanner as red raspberries. However, considerable space \nis needed for each plant because they produce new canes \nfrom the crown area, as well as strong lateral branches \nwhen pruned properly. Plant black raspberries about 3 to \n4 feet apart within the row, and plant the more vigorous purple raspberries 3 to 5 feet apart in the row.\nMost thorny blackberries produce suckers profusely \nand should be planted 3 to 4 feet apart to form a uni -\nform hedgerow of canes. Thornless blackberries do not produce many suckers, but their growth is vigorous and \nnew canes develop from the original crown. Plant thorn -\nless blackberries in a hill system with each plant set 4 to 6 feet apart within the row.\nDetermine the number of plants required per acre \nby calculating the number of feet of row per acre, then dividing this number by the distance \nin feet between plants within the \nrow.

See \u201cPlant Selec-\ntion,\u201d chapter three, for additional details on bramble \ntransplant types.\nTransplanting Dormant Stock\nIt is ideal if the transplants remain dormant until planted, \nbut do not allow the roots to dry out before planting. If \nthe plants arrive too early, those packed in polyethylene-\nlined boxes can be held in cold storage at about 35\u00b0F \n(1\u00b0C) for several weeks. Other plants may be heeled in for \ntemporary storage. Dormant plants may be transplanted \nby hand into trenches or individual holes. Transplant-ing machines also may be adapted to perform this task. Be sure that plants are set vertically as plants set at an angle do not grow well. Apply water immediately after planting.\nPlant red raspberry and thorny blackberry dormant \nsuckers in early spring with their stems at the depth they \nwere in the nursery. Spread roots laterally from the sucker \nstem and place the roots slightly deeper than they were in the nursery soil. Prune the dormant transplant to a height of 5 inches, and then remove this woody portion once new shoots emerge from the soil.\nPlant tip-layered canes, i.e., black or purple raspberry \nand thornless blackberry dormant transplants, in early \nspring with the tips of their crown buds pointing upwards. \nPlace the center of the crown about 3 inches below the \nsoil surface, so that bud tips are approximately 2\u00bd inches \ndeep. If buds have begun to grow before planting, their \ntips should be closer to the surface. Spread roots laterally \nand slightly downward and pack soil firmly around roots \nto minimize air spaces. However, avoid damaging buds when tamping the soil. Cut off the handle (the piece of the stem extending above the soil) close to the ground once new shoots emerge from the soil.\nTransplanting Tissue-cultured Plants\nPlanting greenhouse-grown, tissue-cultured plants can \nbe easy and quick since some kinds of semi-mechanized \nvegetable and tobacco transplanting equipment can be adapted for use with these types of transplants. Growth of tissue-cultured bramble plants is also more uniform and vigorous than dormant transplant material. However, \nnot all cultivars are available as tissue-cultured plants. \nFurther, tissue-cultured plants have shallow root systems, \nwhich are sensitive to dry soil and herbicides, and the transplants are susceptible to frost damage.\nDelay transplanting of tissue-cultured plants until \ndamage by late-spring frosts is no longer a hazard. Cover \nthe top of the root ball with field soil to a depth of \n\u00be inch. Pack soil to ensure good contact with the root ball. Apply water in the transplant hole, and irrigate the entire planting immediately after transplanting. Avoid \nherbicide applications and disturbances of the root system \nin new plantings.\nNurseries sometimes produce purple and black rasp -\nberry stock by rooting semi-hardened, leafy cuttings. This \nstock is often sent while actively growing if the time and \nmethod of sale is appropriate. Handle these transplants \nin the same manner as greenhouse-grown, tissue-cultured \nplants. If cuttings are dormant, however, they may be \nhandled by the same methods as tip-layered plants.\nRoot Cuttings\nAlternatively brambles can be grown from root cuttings. Root cuttings are generally planted in spring after they have been dug in fall and stored in a refrigerator during \nwinter.

For blackberries, plant pencil size (6 inches \nlong and \u215c- to \u215d-inch diameter) root pieces.\nEarly Care\nHelp maintain soil moisture around the delicate roots \nof bramble plants by amending the soil with compost or \nanother source of organic matter prior to planting. After \nplanting, a light layer of straw mulch will help retain \nsoil moisture during plant establishment. Alternatively \nmoisture may be retained and weeds managed by plant -\ning brambles in plastic mulch, although this mulch will have to be removed at the beginning of the second year to allow new primocanes to emerge (figure 4.4).\nMinimize weed competition in a bramble planting but \navoid cultivation or herbicides until the plants are well \nestablished. Fertilizer should not be applied to brambles \nimmediately after they are planted; root systems are \nvery delicate at this time and fertilizers will likely burn them. The use of dilute liquid fertilizer is generally fine for a new planting.\nMost first-year growth occurs in the root system. \nFirst-year primocanes rarely reach an adequate height to produce a significant harvest. For convenience, many \ngrowers mow first-year canes to the ground in the fall or \nearly spring. Eliminating the first-year short canes reduces \nthe time and expense of managing and harvesting their nominal crop and allows the second-year primocanes to grow unimpeded.\nTo manage between-row weeds, most growers either \nuse clean cultivation between rows (figure 4.5) or plant \ngrass and mow the alleyways. Some growers plant flower -\ning species between rows to attract beneficial insects \n(figure 4.6). A good time to seed grass is the fall of the planting year when soil temperatures are still warm, yet \nrainfall and soil moisture are generally higher. Leave \na 3- to 4-foot unseeded strip around the bramble plants \nto minimize competition between the bramble plants and \ngrass. Perennial ryegrass, dwarf fescues, bluegrass mixes, \nor a combination of these, make an attractive and durable \nground cover. Avoid faster-growing and more aggressive \nmixes such as conservation or contractor\u2019s mixes. \nOnce plants are well established in fall of the planting \nyear, herbicides may be applied, if necessary. Do not leave \nany straw or plastic mulch on raspberries after the first \nyear as the excessive moisture may increase the incidence of Phytophthora root rot. On drier soils, other mulching \nmaterials, such as wood chips or shavings, applied in a layer 4 to 6 inches thick may be used to retain moisture and prevent weed seed germination. The use of mulch on wet, heavy soils is generally not recommended.\nUsing Rowcovers\nRowcovers can be used to accelerate the flowering and \nripening of primocane-fruiting raspberries (figure 4.7, \npage 32). The harvest of primocane-fruiting types such \nas Heritage frequently is truncated by fall frost. By apply -\ning rowcover in early spring, growth is accelerated and flowering and fruiting can occur 10\u201314 days earlier than normal, resulting in a much larger harvest in fall. Apply rowcover after the snow melts but before the new canes \nemerge from the ground. Be sure to anchor it well as \nhigh and persistent winds often occur this time of year.

The plastic \ncovering is a type that allows light to penetrate, traps \nsome heat, and is durable in sunlight. Rapid advances \nare being made in plastic coverings, so consult a spe -\ncialist for the latest recommendation before purchasing \na cover. Tunnels are less expensive \nthan greenhouses for extending the \nseason and protecting plants from \nadverse weather. Temperature inside \nthe tunnel is regulated by rolling the \nsides up or down and opening or \nclosing the end walls. For the most \npart, tunnels do not contain heat -\ners, lights, or any source of power. \nHigh tunnels offer the opportunity \nfor bramble growers in northern cli -\nmates to harvest early in the season \n(May for some floricane-fruiting \ncultivars) and to stay in production \nlater in the season (November for \nsome primocane-fruiting cultivars). \nHigh tunnels also provide protection \nfrom rain and hail and can reduce \ndisease and pest pressure. With good  planning, cultivar selection, and detailed management, \nthis system can greatly extend the harvest season.\nLayout\nHigh tunnels need to be large enough for the grower \nto plant, monitor, and harvest the crop from inside \nthe structure. Standard tunnel dimensions vary with \nthe manufacturer. One common tunnel size is 14 feet \nwide, 96 feet long, and 7\u00bd feet tall at the center, while others are 30 feet wide, 15 feet tall and 96 feet long. A minimum peak height of 9 feet is recommended, and \ninstalling post extensions as high as 4 to 5 feet may \nbe necessary to improve air circulation and reduce heat \naccumulation in the tunnel. Wider tunnels also can make \nmanagement easier, but tunnels should be no wider than \n30 feet. Long tunnels have limited cross ventilation, and \nthe potential stresses caused by the weight of snow can \nbecome an issue. Tunnels longer than 96 feet also may pose a psychological barrier to pickers.\nThe frame consists of metal bows made by bending \nsteel pipe or tubing (figure 4.8). Frames with a peak will \nshed snow better during the winter and are recommended \nover a more gradual bend (Quonset-style frames).

The structure is typi -\ncally covered with a single layer of 6-mil \npolyethylene with IR trapping and UV \nprotection, with provisions for rolling \nup the sidewalls. (Some growers have \nreported better production with spe -\ncial light-diffusing plastic that increases \nlight interception on lower laterals.) The \nplastic is secured onto a batten board on \neach side of the high tunnel about 5 feet \nabove the soil line. A vertical sidewall \nhelps to keep rain out of the tunnel and \nwhen rolled up, provides ventilation. A \npipe is then attached to the loose bottom \nend of the plastic along the length of the \nstructure. A T-handle on the end of the \npipe is used to roll the plastic onto the pipe to open the sides  (figure 4.9).\nThe key to successful use of the high \ntunnel is to spend the time laying out and preparing \nthe site for construction. The better the tunnel is con -\nstructed, the easier the sides will roll up, and the easier it will be to ventilate. During periods of cold weather the sides are lowered in the afternoon to hold heat and then \nraised in the morning to vent before temperatures inside \nget too high. The floor of the structure may be covered with a layer of black weed barrier. This helps to raise the \ntemperature inside the house, controls weeds, prevents \nevaporation of soil moisture, and allows excess water to drain. Excess moisture will raise humidity in the tunnel and may lead to disease problems. Humidity of the air will increase at night as the air cools down. Venting in the morning will allow drying of any condensed water and reduce humidity.\nPlanting Details\nIn a high-tunnel system, bramble plants may be grown \neither in the ground or in containers using media as \nfor greenhouse production. If plants are grown in the \nground, the high tunnel needs to be dedicated to bramble \nproduction unless the tunnel is moveable. Containers \noffer the advantage that a different crop can be grown within the high tunnel early in the year, after which \nthe bramble plants can be moved into the tunnel. Place bramble plants in the high tunnels from bloom through \nharvest. Protecting plants from rain during this time \nperiod helps to control gray mold without fungicides.\nIf plants are grown in the ground, set plants in rows \nat least 6 feet apart. Vigorous growth produced by the \nbramble in tunnels makes management at closer spacing a \nchallenge and increases considerably the amount of time \nrequired to manage the planting. Within the row, how -\never, space primocane-fruiting raspberries more closely \nthan the 3-foot recommendation for field production, \nas vigorous growth in the first year makes it possible \nto harvest a significant crop the year of planting. To \nmaximize first-year harvest, plant transplants as early in \nthe spring as possible, at least four weeks earlier than \nfield production if the tunnel is covered.\nWhile extensive evaluation of cultivar suitability has \nnot been done, characteristics desired may be somewhat \ndifferent than for field production.

A high-tunnel \nsystem may also be used to produce primocane-fruiting \nraspberries later in the season than would be possible \nin an open field if the plastic is not applied until early \nSeptember. Cultivars that produce a bit too late for field \nproduction in some regions (e.g., Josephine) can produce \na significant crop in high tunnels.\nCulture\nThe use of high tunnels does require an increase in both \nthe level and the amount of management required to \ngrow the crop. In particular, the sides must be raised and \nlowered to regulate temperature and humidity in spring and fall. Temperatures under high tunnels are managed \ndifferently depending on the targeted window for harvest. \nFor example, if floricane-fruiting raspberries are to be \nfruited in May or June, then shade cloth may be required \nbeginning in May to reduce temperatures and reduce solar \ninjury on fruit. If primocane-fruiting raspberries are to be \nfruited in November, then plastic may be removed entirely \nfor the summer to reduce heat stress, and replaced once flowering begins. Unless supplemental heat is provided, the tunnel may not be able to provide \nadequate protection to the plants after \nmid-November, although rowcovers \ncan be used within tunnels to protect plants on cold nights.\nPruning, trellising, and tipping canes \nis different under tunnels than for open-\nfield production. For example, tipping \nprimocanes to delay harvest may be \ndesirable in a high tunnel, but is prob -\nably undesirable in the field. Chapter \nfive provides details on cane manage -\nment under tunnels.\nHigh tunnels can reduce the inci -\ndence of some diseases and insects, \nparticularly if trickle-irrigation tubing is used, as no water (rain or irrigation) \ngets onto the foliage to transport spores \nor otherwise encourage disease develop-\nment. Keeping air flowing through the \ntunnel when possible will also minimize the likelihood of disease development. Season extenders \nsuch as floating row covers or screens can be used as physi -\ncal barriers to keep insects off the crop. Fruit harvested \nfrom tunnels without any fungicide applications is usually \nof higher quality than field-grown fruit that has received \nregular fungicide treatments.\nSome disease and insect damage can occur in high \ntunnels. Scouting must begin when the plants are set out. \nPowdery mildew and two-spotted spider mites are a com -\nmon pest under protected culture. Scout for two-spotted \nmites at least weekly, and more often if the weather is hot. \nThe use of beneficial insects may be the most practical \nway to deal with mite problems. Mite populations can \nexplode, so if two-spotted mites are observed, order and \nrelease predatory mites immediately (see \u201cInsect and Mite \nScouting and Management,\u201d chapter eight).\nThe potential for nutritional deficiencies to occur in \nhigh tunnels is greater than in field production as plant \ngrowth is significantly increased. A yearly  comple te-\n tissue-nutrient analysis is needed to best guide a fertiliza -\ntion program. Preplant compost incorporation will also \nhelp ameliorate potential deficiencies. If the tunnel is \ncovered year-round, irrigation will be required very early \nin spring since rain and snow are excluded.\nBumblebees may be required to maximize production \nin the early and late part of the sea -\nson when the sides are rolled up infre -\nquently. The bees flying in and out of \ntheir boxes will visit the various flowers \non their way in and out each day, which \nshould provide adequate pollination. \nHowever, in the fall, bumblebees are \nattracted to the warm, dry environment \nof a high tunnel, so purchasing bees may \nnot be necessary at that time of year.\nGreenhouse  \nRaspberry Production\nGreenhouses offer raspberry growers in \nnorthern climates the opportunity to \nprovide the consumer with high-quality \nfruit in the middle of the winter (figure \n4.10).

The following \ndescribes how a greenhouse is used \nto produce early spring raspberries \nwithout the use of a cooler. Varia -\ntions on this scheme are provided in \nthe Greenhouse Raspberry Produc -\ntion Guide available on the web at \nwww.fruit.cornell.edu/Berries/\nghrasp.html.\nLayout\nA greenhouse with a heat source is required for main-taining warm temperatures of up to 70\u00b0F inside while \nthe weather is cold outside. Coolers and venting may \nbe necessary for late spring production. Other materials needed include a clean water source with low salinity, a \nfertilizer injector, an irrigation system, min/max ther -\nmometers, growing media, and containers. Other supplies \nthat are valuable include growing lights, humidity gauges, \nand a weed barrier for gravel greenhouse floors.\nSupplemental lighting is not necessary for success -\nful greenhouse raspberry production, but if lights are \nalready installed in the greenhouse, supplemental light \ncan accelerate harvest by a couple of weeks and may \nincrease yield by 20\u201330%. The expense of adding supple -\nmental lighting just for raspberries may not be offset by higher yields.\nThe use of inexpensive box fans on the greenhouse \nfloor will provide air circulation around the plants to help \nreduce pockets of high humidity that encourage disease. \nThe relative humidity should be maintained between \n65\u201375%. Relative humidity below 65% will encourage \nmite infestations as well as poor pollination, and relative \nhumidity greater than 90% will encourage fruit mold and \npoor pollination. Humidity levels will vary depending on whether the greenhouse floor is gravel or concrete. \nConcrete floors tend to absorb moisture much more and \ntherefore may need to be sprayed with water during the day in order to maintain sufficient humidity.\nThe greenhouse provides an excellent environment for \npests and disease organisms to thrive. The greenhouse must \nbe thoroughly cleaned before any raspberries are moved \nin. Maintaining an empty greenhouse at temperatures \ngreater than 104\u00b0F and relative humidity at less than 50% \nfor three to four days will eradicate many insects.\nAn irrigation system is necessary for greenhouse \nraspberry production (figure 4.12). Usually one or two spaghetti tubes in each pot from a plastic irrigation line \nare adequate. Water pH and EC (electrical conductivity, \nor soluble salts in the water) will vary from one region to another. A water analysis can be done to determine \nif your water source falls within the optimal pH and \nEC ranges for raspberries (6.0 to 6.5 pH, < 30 ppm \nsodium, < 50 ppm chlorine, with an EC < 3 mS/cm). \nFor more detailed explanations on water and nutrient \naspects of greenhouse operations, please consult Water \nand Nutrient Management for Greenhouses  (see Further \nReading at the end of this chapter).\nMeasure the available greenhouse space to determine Fig. 4\u0003.11 Titan fruiting \nin the greenhouse.\nFig. 4\u0003.12 Irrigation system in \ngreenhouse production.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

The floricane-fruiting Tulameen has proven to be an outstanding cultivar that consistently produces a high-quality raspberry in the greenhouse with few \ninsect and pathogen pest issues (figure 4.13).\nTissue culture virus-indexed transplants have the best \ngrowth and productivity and will generally live longer. \nWhen planting, the top of the root ball should be covered \nwith a soil medium to a depth of \u00be inches. Medium \nshould be pressed to ensure good contact with the root \nball. Fill containers two-thirds full, applying a few inches \nof compost to the pot surface to retain moisture and \nbegin irrigating immediately after transplanting.\nThe containers can be placed outdoors for the first \ngrowing season if danger of spring frost is past. Pest \nmanagement materials are usually easier to apply out -\ndoors in comparison to a greenhouse. Place the plants \nin full sun, out of the wind, and on a growing bed \nwith a weed barrier and automated drip irrigation. A \nnorth-south orientation is preferred for better light \ninterception. Sufficient spacing between the rows of \nat least 8 to 10 feet should be allowed for maximum sun exposure on the lower portions of the canes. If the plants are too close together, the lower buds will not produce fruiting laterals once they are moved into the greenhouse.\nDuring hot, sunny, and/or windy days, the containers \nmay need to be watered more than once a day.

Once moved inside and flowering begins, \nreduce the overall rate to 50 ppm to avoid excessively \nlush canopy growth and soft fruit. Raspberries appear to \ngrow best with a higher proportion of nitrogen relative to the phosphorus and potassium found in commercial formulations. Therefore, it may be necessary to use two \nstock solutions to obtain the right balance between nitro -\ngen and the other nutrients (see sidebar). Remove any weeds growing in the containers as they are a source of competition for nutrients and moisture.\nAs the primocanes grow during that first season \noutdoors, support stakes will be necessary to keep the canes upright in the wind. This upright stability can be \nachieved through relatively simple measures such as run -\nning a series of twine support lines between strategically \nlocated bamboo stakes.\nOutside insects and diseases should be minimal. Scout \nweekly especially to monitor for Japanese beetles, ori -\nental beetles, and raspberry sawfly larvae (see \u201cInsect \nand Mite Scouting and Management,\u201d chapter eight). \nConventional pest control measures can be used when plants are outdoors.\nIn early fall cut back on watering and fertilizing, but \ndo not allow the containers to completely dry out. After \nleaf drop, move the pots closer together and surround \nthem with bales of straw to protect them from cold \ntemperatures. In most regions, the chilling requirement (800 to 1200 hours of temperatures between 28\u00b0F and 45\u00b0F) is usually met by late December, and containers \ncan be moved into the greenhouse. To ensure that a \nsufficient number of chilling hours has been achieved, \nplants can be moved into a cooler (that does not contain \nother fruit that can produce ethylene gas) for eight weeks \nprior to moving them into a warm greenhouse. If natural \nchilling is relied upon and fall temperatures are mild, \nthen chilling may not occur until later than desired. To avoid cold injury, less hardy cultivars such as Tulameen may have to be moved into an unheated greenhouse or building if temperatures are forecast to fall below 20\u00b0F for several consecutive hours.\nSome nurseries may be able to provide \u201clong canes\u201d \nor bare-root canes that are dug from the nursery after the chilling requirement is fulfilled. These plants can be directly potted and fruited without waiting one or two \nyears for fruiting canes to develop from young plants. \nShipping costs will be high, however.Initial temperatures in the greenhouse should be \nmaintained at 50\u00b0F at night and about 65\u00b0F during \nthe day. Once plants fully leaf out, the temperature can \nbe maintained as low as 55\u00b0F during the evening and \nas high as 70\u00b0F during the day. The plants will flower \nin approximately five to eight weeks. Proper pollina -\ntion is essential for optimal fruit set. Purchase bumble bee hives as these pollinators function better at cooler \ntemperatures and under cloudier skies than do honey \nbees. Bumblebees are also relatively docile and will not sting unless provoked.\nPruning and trellising recommendations are different \nin a greenhouse than in the open field. Details can be found in chapter five.\nA two-year-old mature plant will produce between \n10 and 15 half-pints or more of fruit over about an \neight-week period.

Proper \ntrellising and pruning allow a grower to manipulate \ncane growth and positively influence plant growth rate, \nfruit quantity and size, soluble solids (sugars), disease \nsusceptibility, ease of harvest, and spraying efficiency. \nPrimocane-Fruiting (Fall-Fruiting)  \nRed Raspberries\nPrimocane-fruiting raspberries produce fruit at the top of \nfirst-year canes in late summer. If allowed to overwinter, \nthese same canes will produce fruit again in early summer \nof the second year on lower portions of the same cane \n( double-cropping). However, the quality of the early-\n summer fruit is inferior to both the late-  summer primo -\ncane crop and the summer crop of  florica ne- fruiti ng types. \nAlso, harvesting the early-summer crop from  primoc ane-\nfruiting types is difficult because new primocanes grow \namong the fruiting canes, making harvest difficult. Like -\nwise, the late-summer primocane crop is smaller when the \nsecond-year canes are allowed to fruit in summer. Conse -\nquently, with primocane-fruiting raspberries most growers \nfavor managing canes for a single late-summer primo-\ncane crop. Additional advantages of a single-  croppi ng  \nsystem are that it eliminates cane thinning, detailed \n pruning, tying, cold injury and winter dam -\nage from rabbits or voles; it reduces spur \nblight, anthracnose, cane blight, and sap beetle damage; and it makes applications of fertilizers and pesticides easier.\nTrellising\nA temporary trellis for primocane-  fruiti ng \nraspberries during the harvest season will \nallow easy movement between plant rows, \nkeep the top-heavy canes from drooping over to the ground, and make harvesting fruit easier. A simple T-trellis works well. It consists of T-shaped wooden or metal posts (e.g., rebar), approxi -\nmately 7 feet tall, with a 2-foot cross arm (figure 5.1). The \nends of the cross arms have a screw eye or other hardware \nto hold a length of baling twine. The baling twine is cheap \nand disposable, yet strong enough to temporarily hold \ncanes upright. Each T-shaped post is set into a hole in \nthe center of each row; holes are placed 25 to 30 feet apart \nwithin rows. The holes should be 2 feet deep and slightly \nwider than the diameter of the base of the posts. A 2-foot \nsection of plastic PVC pipe can be set into the holes imme -\ndiately after they are dug to prevent them from collapsing.\nJust before harvest, T-posts are slid into the plastic-\nlined holes. The baling twine is strung from pole to pole and pulled tight to lift canes upright. After harvest, the twine can be cut and the posts removed and stored for \nanother year. Since the plastic pipe is buried, it can remain \nin the ground where it will not \ninterfere with cane-  cuttin g \n operations.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

New \ncanes will grow and fruit in late summer and the cycle will continue. It is important to cut old canes as close to the ground as possible so that new buds will break from below the soil surface. If canes are not cut low enough, \nfruiting laterals may form on any remaining cane portion. \nThese fruiting laterals are not healthy; they are entry sites \nfor insects and disease pathogens. Also, any fruits that \nform will most likely rot, attracting pathogens and creat -\ning a source of inoculum (disease-conducting material) \nfor the late-summer crop. All canes that are cut from the \nplanting should be removed from the area and destroyed. \nIn warm climates, the primocane crop can be delayed by \nmowing the young primocanes a second time when they \nare approximately 6 inches tall. Pinching the primocanes \n(removing the growing tip) to stimulate growth of later -\nals will also delay fruiting. This is sometimes done in the \nSouth to delay harvest until after the intense heat of July.\nThe timing of cane cutting is also important. Car -\nbohydrates move from plant leaves into the crown in \nautumn, and from the crown to the buds in early spring. \nIf canes are cut before all the carbohydrates reach the crown in autumn, the new canes may not be as vigorous the following year. Canes can also be cut too late, after \ncarbohydrates have moved into the buds. From December \nthrough February, most carbohydrates are in the crown, so this is the ideal time to cut canes.\nYield of primocane-fruiting types is largely influenced \nby the number of canes per unit area, up to about 15 per \nsquare meter (10 square feet). Since large numbers of canes do not seem to decrease fruit size in the fall crop of primocane-fruiting raspberries, growers generally do not thin canes. Some benefit may be realized by remov-ing weak canes, but the effort may not be economically justified. Row widths of 12 to 18 inches are considered \nideal for harvesting. Narrow rows generally result in \nhigher yields per planted area, so small equipment is \noften more desirable.\nFloricane-Fruiting (Summer-Fruiting) \nBrambles\nFloricane-fruiting brambles produce fruit only from \nbuds on second-year canes. Unlike primocane-fruiting \nraspberries, these canes must remain intact throughout the \nwinter and following growing season, until the comple -\ntion of harvest. Also, during second-year flowering and \nfruiting on floricanes, new first-year primocanes are \ngrowing. These primocanes can interfere with spraying \nand harvesting, shade the leaves and laterals of floricanes, \nand compete for water since they share a single root \nsystem. Cane winter damage and primocane interference \nand competition must be minimized through trellising \nand pruning to obtain a high yield of fruit each year.\nTrellising\nMany methods of trellising floricane-fruiting bramble \ncanes exist, including an I-trellis, which ties plants to a \nsingle wire 3 to 4 feet above the ground, or a T-  trellis, \nwhich ties plants to two wires 3 to 4 feet above the ground. \nSome growers angle posts into the ground, forming a V, \nbut the V-trellis and T-trellis are functionally similar. \nAn I-trellis will help prevent cane breakage, but since it \nFig. 5.2  I-trellis system used with black raspberries.\n Fig. 5.3  Four-wire T-trellis with two cross arms.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

It also makes adjustments for annual variations in \ncane height difficult. The disadvantages of the I-trellis \ncan be addressed with a split canopy trellis (T or V). \nCane interference and competition can be reduced and \nyields increased by separating the fruiting canes from \nvegetative canes. \nWith the V-trellis system, anchoring posts are placed \nat thirty-foot intervals at a 20\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 angle along the outer margins of each plant row to form a V-shaped \nstructure. Monofilament plastic wires are strung at two \nheights along the posts through screw eyes or other inex -\npensive hardware and pulled taut (figures 5.4 and 5.5). \nFruiting canes are tied to wires on the outside of the V, and primocanes are permitted to grow in the center of the V. Spraying, harvesting, and pruning operations are made easier since floricanes are outside and accessible, \nand primocane interference is minimized. Also, the pres -\nence of primocanes in the center of the row forces fruit -\ning laterals to grow outward.

In some \nplaces, half of the floricanes are tied \nto each side of the V. Elsewhere, \ngrowers tie floricanes to one side \nof the V and train primocanes to \nthe other side.

When \nflowering begins, the wires and the \nattached floricanes are moved to a \nwider position, making a V configu -\nration, while primocanes take the \ncenter position. Additional wires on \na lower crossbar may be needed to \nsupport the fruiting canes. Care must \nbe taken not to damage the fruiting \nlaterals when spreading the flori -\ncanes. The outward direction of the \nfruiting laterals, which results from \nspreading the floricanes during flow -\nering, makes harvest easy and effi -\ncient. After harvest, the outer wires are removed and the dying fruiting canes are bent out at right angles to the row and cut, while middle wires hold the primocanes erect.\nFor thornless blackberries the \ndouble curtain V-trellis has been \nvery successful. Fruiting canes are \ntied to one side of the V and pri -\nmocanes to the other. Primocanes \nand floricanes alternate sides of rows \nacross the field, so each alleyway is bordered by canes of the same age. \nThis pattern makes spraying and \nharvesting easier.\nA swinging-arm trellis can facili-\ntate harvest in thornless blackberries \nand other flexible-caned brambles. \nThis system has a single arm that \nswivels on a post about 3 feet off the \nground.

If primocanes are suppressed when reaching 6\u20138 \ninches tall, shading on the lower portions of floricanes \nis reduced and energy is diverted into fruiting canes. \nHarvesting is easier because smaller primocanes cause \nless interference.

Once fruit set occurs and \nflower petals drop, the entire trellis \narm is shifted about 135 degrees to the other side of the row. All of the fruit is now leaning out towards the \npickers, making harvest easy. Once \nthe fruit is harvested, the floricanes \nare removed, the arm is shifted to \nhorizontal, and the growing primo -\ncanes are brought up onto the swing -\ning arm where they will remain until \nnext year.\nPruning\nFive general methods of  prunin g \n floricane-fruiting brambles for field \nproduction are described below. Each \nmethod will produce different results in the growth of \nprimocanes and floricanes. For all methods, maintain row \nwidths at no greater than 12 inches to concentrate new cane growth under the trellis, and to prevent canes from \n growing in the alleyways.\nIn the following descriptions, mowing refers to removal \nof all canes at ground level. Suppression refers to removing \nor chemically suppressing the first flush of primocanes \nwhen they emerge in spring, forcing the plant to produce \nnew canes later in spring. Selective pruning refers to the \nremoval of floricanes in early spring, generally by removing \nweak spindly canes and retaining thick fruitful canes.\nSelective Pruning with No Mowing \nor Suppression of Primocanes \nThis training system is traditionally used by bramble \ngrowers in the Northeast. Primocanes emerge and are \npermitted to grow throughout the season. The follow -\ning year, they become floricanes, flowering and fruiting \nas new primocanes emerge (figure 5.10A).

Primocanes contribute \nlarge amounts of carbohydrates to the bramble plant, \nand repeated suppression will reduce carbohydrate levels. \nTherefore, suppression should be skipped every third or \nfourth year to allow the planting to recover from the \ngeneral reduction in vigor. Weak hills or sections of rows \nshould not be suppressed at all.\nThere are conditions under which suppression of \nprimocanes is not recommended. If a fruit-crop load is particularly heavy, primocane growth may decrease natu -\nrally as developing fruit demands all the plant\u2019s resources. \nAlso, if primocanes are suppressed in regions with short \ngrowing seasons, they may be too short at the end of \nthe growing season. Suppression is not recommended \nunder the above conditions, or whenever the plant is \nstressed from a lack of moisture or a nutritional imbalance.\nAdvantages of primocane suppression are: (1) increases \nin fruit size and quality, (2) increases in production, \nand (3) reduced cane numbers. Disadvantages are: (1) \nlong-term reductions in stand vigor and (2) expenses \ninvolved with primocane suppression or elimination. \nFurthermore, there are no universally accepted methods of suppressing primocanes chemically.\nPartial Primocane Suppression\nYield and quality may be increased without suppressing all the primocanes in a planting. Removing all but 4 or 5 primocanes per linear foot of row will increase yield and fruit quality in some cultivars.\nFor this method, growers select the primocanes in \nlate spring which will be carried into the following year \nfor fruiting.

The raspberry plant uses resources for \nthe current fruiting canes and the remaining primocanes, \nrather than for many primocanes which would eventually \nbe removed with the conventional system.\nPrimocane regrowth is ignored until the dormant \nseason when these short canes are removed (figure 5.10C). \nAdvantages of this system are: (1) selected primocanes grow for an entire season instead of the partial season \nunder complete primocane suppression, (2) rejected \nprimocanes are removed when small, succulent, and easy Fig. 5.11  Left: Rampant growth of purple raspberries.\n Right: Same field of purple raspberries the following year with primocane suppression.\nFig. 5.12  Selective thinning of \nprimocanes in early summer.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

The major disadvantages are: (1) primocane selection is dif -\nficult when leaves are on the plant, and (2) suppression of undesirable canes requires much labor.\nAlternate-Year Mowing\nOne method that growers use to reduce the expense of selective cane removal (by hand) is to mow the planting to the ground (by machine) during the dormant season. This technique does not permit any yield the year canes are mowed, but concentrates the crop in the year after mowing. By mowing half the planting in any one year, growers can still harvest annually. \nWith alternate-year mowing, primocane interference \namong floricanes is reduced. In the spring after mowing, \nprimocanes will emerge and grow without interference \nfrom fruiting canes (figure 5.10D). The following year, the \nfloricanes will flower and fruit (figure 5.10E). Although primocanes will also grow in the fruiting year, all canes \nwill be cut to the ground during the next dormant season. \nAdvantages of this method are that no detailed cane \nthinning or pruning are required, and spray material \ncosts are reduced approximately 50%. Disadvantages \ninclude a reduction in fruit quality, berry size, and yield of \napproximately 30% for most cultivars, since only half the \nplanting is fruiting in any one year.\nAlternate-Year Mowing with \nPrimocane Suppression\nThe reduction in yield caused by \nalternate-year mowing can be par-\ntially offset by removing all primo -\ncanes from the plant row during \nthe fruiting year. After the first few \nflushes of growth are removed, pri -\nmocanes eventually will be allowed \nto grow, but practically, the system is \nbiennial. Primocanes grow without \ninterference from floricanes, and \nfloricanes grow without interference \nfrom primocanes. \nThe advantages of this method \nare: (1) the ease of pruning when \ndone in early spring, (2) a reduc -\ntion in spray materials cost, and (3) reduced canes diseases. Disadvantages are: (1) a \nsmall reduction in yield over the long-term, since only \nhalf the planting is fruiting in any one year, and (2) the \ncost of primocane suppression (labor, materials). \nRed (and Yellow) Raspberries \nProductivity in summer-fruiting red and yellow rasp -\nberries is most closely related to the number of canes. \nUnlike the  situation with primocane-fruiting raspberries, \nhowever, fruit size decreases as cane numbers increase. \nGrowers must maintain a high number of canes, but not \nhigh enough to greatly reduce fruit quality. In general, \nthree to five large canes per linear foot of row is the \noptimal range, with a plant row width of 12 inches and \na between-row spacing of 9 feet (figure 5.13). A greater density is optimal if between-row spacing is wider.\nOn summer-fruiting raspberries, buds at the top of \na cane often winter kill because they are less mature and less hardy than buds lower on the cane. Spring pruning \nshould be delayed until winter injury on canes can be \nidentified, usually by mid-March. Canes should be topped \nas high as the trellis and harvest operations will permit, but below the point of winter injury. Severe topping will \nincrease fruit size but will greatly reduce yield. To prevent \na loss in yield, no more than the top one-fourth of a cane \nshould be removed.\nFig. 5.13  Before and after winter pruning for red and black raspberries. \n A Black raspberry before winter pruning; B Black raspberry after winter pruning. \nC Red raspberry before winter pruning; D Red raspberry after winter pruning.\nC\n D\nA\n B\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

Each method will produce \ndifferent effects on yield and productivity. After pruning, \ncanes are tied loosely to the trellis wire to prevent wind \ndamage of laterals after bud break. Canes should be \nspaced evenly along the trellis wire and equally divided \nbetween sides of a V-trellis.\nTipping (pinching off the tips) of red raspberry pri -\nmocanes during the growing season to promote lateral growth is not recommended for field production. This procedure slows cane development, does not stimulate \nmuch branching, and makes the plant susceptible to \nwinter injury and cane diseases.\nBlack Raspberries\nIn contrast to red raspberries, black raspberries respond \nwell to primocane tipping. Many more fruiting buds are \nproduced on black raspberry lateral branches than on the \nmain cane, so when primocanes reach about 28 inches, \npinch them back to stimulate lateral branching from the \nmain cane. At least 4 inches of tip should be removed during pinching. Several passes through the field may be required since canes grow at different rates. Ideally, primocanes should be tipped just above a bud. Tipped canes can be a site for cane blight infection, especially if wet weather follows tipping.\nSome growers tip black raspberries mechanically \nby shortening fruiting canes to a \nheight of 22 inches in early spring. \nLater in the spring, several passes \nare made with a sickle bar mower \nat 24 inches. Although this method \nis less labor intensive than tipping, \nprimocanes will be more susceptible \nto cane blight infection since there is little control over wound size or the amount of dead wood between the cut and first bud.\nAt the end of the first year, black \nraspberry primocanes are branched \nwith long laterals. These lateral \nbranches should be supported by \ntrellis wires before October since \nwet snow tends to break them off of \nthe main cane. Also, canes are more flexible in early autumn than in late autumn and are less \nprone to breaking from the crown during trellising.\nA large portion of lateral branches may be killed dur -\ning the winter since black raspberries generally are not as \nhardy as red raspberries. Laterals are shortened (headed \nback) in early spring to remove winter-damaged wood and \nto maintain berry size. Some growers shorten laterals to \nless than 10 inches. The choice of lateral length depends \non cultivar vigor and the relationship between crop size \nand fruit size. The relationships among productivity, fruit \nsize, and lateral length are not well known.\nWhatever general pruning method is chosen, leaving \n4 to 6 canes per crown should give most growers accept -\nable yields of large fruit (figure 5.13). Black raspberries will respond well to partial primocane suppression. Full \nsuppression is not recommended because black raspber -\nries produce few primocanes.\nPurple Raspberries\nPurple raspberries perform best if pruned similarly to red \nraspberries (figure 5.14). Purple raspberry primocanes may \nbe tipped, like black raspberries, but wounds are often an \nentry site for cane diseases which kill part of the cane.\nIf a grower chooses not to tip or suppress purple \nraspberry primocanes, the canes will grow very tall (see figure 5.11).

These canes may \nbe removed or allowed to fruit.\nIf primocanes are tipped to keep the plant short and \ncompact, it should be done when primocanes reach a \nheight of 32 inches. At least 4 inches of tip must be \nremoved. Many lateral buds will break near the top of the \ncane, and fewer near the base. Lateral branches should be \nshortened below any winter damage in early spring.\nTipped plantings without cane diseases will generally \nproduce higher yields, but berries on the long laterals are \nmore difficult to harvest. Also, long lateral branch or cane \nlength generally results in smaller fruit size. Larger fruit \ncan be obtained by shortening canes or lateral branches in early spring, but at the expense of yield.\nPruning methods that leave three to four fruiting canes \nper linear foot of row produce acceptable yield and quality \nof fruit. Purple raspberries respond favorably to primocane \nsuppression but do not respond well to mowing.\nThornless Blackberries\nFor two years after planting, thornless blackberry primo -\ncanes tend to grow along the ground, like a vine. Grow -\ners may have to move trailing canes in the direction of the row to allow room for cultivation. After two years, \nhowever, canes become more erect and are naturally \nbranched. Thornless blackberry canes are thicker and \nmore flexible than raspberry canes.\nBecause of the poor hardiness of thornless blackber-\nries, northern growers must take special precautions to \nprotect canes during winter. Although canes are somewhat \nflexible, they will not bend to the ground after the third year to be covered with mulch or straw. Some growers \ntip thornless blackberry primocanes when they reach \na height of 24 inches so that low-growing laterals are more easily protected during winter.\nIn spring, the canes should be tied at least 3 feet \nabove the ground to trellis wires. Fruiting canes are \neither shortened to the top trellis wire or woven around the wire. Woven canes should overlap no more than 2 \nor 3 feet with an adjacent plant.

Although a V or T \ntrellis may capture more light, they also require more \nspace. In a greenhouse or high tunnel where space is at a premium, narrow rows should prevail. \nFloricane-fruiting cultivars\nNew emerging primocanes can grow as much as 15 \nfeet in the first season and must be pinched back or \nthe first flush removed so they do not become a major source of competition with the fruiting floricanes or get in the way of harvesting the fruit. Remove the small -\nest and the largest primocanes at the soil level, leaving \nonly four healthy primocanes (about \u00bd inch in diam -\neter) for next year\u2019s crop. Alternatively, remove the first flush of primocanes and allow the second flush to grow. When the primocanes reach a height of approximately \n3 feet, pinch their tips. This will temporarily halt the primocane\u2019s growth and limit primocane interference \nwhen harvesting fruit from floricanes. The primocanes will break a bud below the pinched area and once again \ncontinue to grow later in the season. Under warm, sunny \nconditions, multiple pinching may be required, perhaps every three weeks.\nPrimocane-fruiting cultivars\nIn the greenhouse, primocane-fruiting raspberries will \nflower and fruit several months after planting. To promote \nadditional flowering, remove the expended portion of \nthe cane. New fruiting laterals will break below the cut, \nand additional flowering and fruiting will occur. New \nprimocanes also may emerge for additional fruiting in several months.\nIn a high tunnel, flowering can be delayed until late \nfall by tipping the primocanes before they flower, usually \nwhen canes are between 24 and 36 inches tall. The earlier \nthe canes are tipped, the longer the delay. This is desirable \nwhen a late market is available for raspberries.\nFurther Reading\nCrandall, P .C. 1995. Bramble Production.

The increase in berry size \nfrom fruit set through ripening is \ndue primarily to an increase in cell \nsize, rather than to division of exist -\ning cells in the undeveloped fruit. \nThis increase in cell size (called cell \nexpansion) is highly dependent on \nwater availability. A raspberry plant \ngrowing vigorously in the summer \ncan evapotranspire up to a quarter \nof an inch of water each day and can \ndeplete all available moisture within \njust a few days after a heavy rainfall.

However, only certain fun -\ngicides are labeled for chemi  gation \nin brambles. Other pesticides that \nare not labeled for this application method in brambles should not be used this way. \nNutrients, particularly nitrogen \nfertilizer, are frequently injected \nthrough irrigation systems. There are \nseveral advantages to this method of \nnutrient application. It is often less expensive, since the cost is limited \nto placing the nutrient solution in \nan injector. The soil compaction that \nresults from driving machinery over \na field is avoided as well. Fertilizer \ndistribution is highly dependent on the injector and flow \nrate used. A comparison of injectors is detailed in table 6.1.\nIrrigation systems used for chemigation should apply \nwater and chemicals uniformly. Furthermore, backflow prevention devices are required any time chemicals are \ninjected into irrigation water. These devices may be quite \nexpensive if you use municipal water supplies, but they are critical for protecting the water supply.Trickle Irrigation Systems \nfor Water Application\nTrickle (drip) irrigation is the preferred system for most \nbramble growers as it offers many advantages (table 6.2). \nIn trickle systems water is most often delivered via a tube \nthat runs along the length of the row (figure 6.2). This \ndelivery system is more efficient than overhead sprinklers \nbecause water is delivered directly to the soil surface sur -\nrounding the plant. No water is applied between rows, \nand less water is lost to evaporation. For most on-farm \nuses, trickle systems are rated at 80 to 90% efficiency and \nsprinkler systems around 60 to 75%. System efficiency is \nespecially important when the water supply is limited or \nexpensive to access. Trickle systems also keep the plant \nfoliage and fruit drier, which can help discourage the \ndevelopment of fungal and bacterial diseases.\nPlanning an Irrigation System\nMany growers consult professional irrigation design -\ners (either from private companies or state/provincial Fig. 6.2  New raspberry planting with trickle irrigation.\nIrrigation Factor Trickle as Compared to Overhead\nWater storage \ncapacityTrickle irrigation requires about half the water needed by overhead systems. Water is used more efficiently since it is applied to the root zone. \nPump and pipe networkTrickle requires lower flow rates and operating pressures, so less energy is required for pumping. Smaller pumps and pipes are required.\nWater use efficiencyPlants are supplied with the water they need, not an excessive amount.\nDisease/weed managementDiseases that develop when free water is on leaf and fruit surfaces do not develop with trickle irrigation, since water is applied directly to the root zone. Weeds are less problematic between rows or in non-irrigated areas. However, weeds can occur at the emitters.\nLabor/automationTrickle irrigation generally requires less labor (particularly when compared to portable overhead pipe, which needs to be moved periodically) and can be extensively automated.\nWind\nWater can be applied efficiently under windy conditions.\nFertilizer Trickle requires less fertilizer, since fertilizer is distributed only near plant roots.\nRodents/insect/people damageThough trickle systems may be eaten/damaged by rodents and insects and damaged by routine field operations, they are relatively easy to repair.Table 6.2  Advantages of trickle irrigation in bramble plantings.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

The water source should be as close as pos -\nsible to the area to be irrigated to minimize the pumping \nand supply line cost. Large ponds, lakes, streams, springs, \ngroundwater, municipal water, and recycled water are all \npotential water sources.\nThe legal right to withdraw large quantities of water \nfor irrigation must be verified. Water rights in the eastern \nUnited States are called riparian or landowner\u2019s rights \nbecause anyone is entitled to use any water associated \nwith land ownership. However, a riparian owner\u2019s rights \nare not absolute and are subject to reasonable use inter -\npretations. In many western states, water is available only \nthrough appropriative rights. In some areas, permits or \nwater use reporting are required before surface water \nor groundwater can be withdrawn for irrigation. Con -\ntact your state or provincial agriculture department for \ninformation on water use regulations.\nWater sources must be able to provide water as often \nas it is needed. Stream flow and shallow groundwater \nsources are strongly influenced by climate, so they may \nnot provide enough water during the dry part of the year \nwhen irrigation is needed most. Sometimes municipal \nwater systems allow connections for irrigation purposes. \nHowever, this option may be expensive if water-use \nprices are high or if large areas need to be irrigated. \nFurthermore, if the municipality enforces water rationing, \nit may not permit irrigation during droughts. Although wastewater sources are generally poor quality and may not supply enough water to fulfill crop needs, they are being used more frequently for irrigation.\nThe irrigation water supply must be large enough to \nreplenish the moisture taken from the rooting volume. \nSince irrigation is not 100% efficient, the water sup -\nply rate must be higher than the crop water use rate. \nCrop water requirements depend on climate, plant type, \nand soil moisture availability. Water supply systems are \ngenerally evaluated using two criteria, seasonal water \ndemand and daily water demand. The water supply \nmust be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the \nirrigation system and must supply enough water to \nmeet crop needs.\nPumping and pressurizing water can be expensive \n(table 6.3). The energy required is often overlooked by growers. Pumping 1 acre-foot of water from a well 100 feet deep with a pump running at 70% efficiency costs \nabout $100 (at $0.10 per kilowatt hour). The energy cost to pressurize surface water to 43 pounds per square inch \n(psi) is the same as lifting the same volume of water \n100 feet. There is also a trade-off in the pumping cost versus the initial pipe cost because it takes more energy to pump water through small diameter pipes.\nSeasonal Water Demand\nSeasonal water demand is the average amount of water \na crop will need for the entire growing season. Growers \nfind this amount useful for sizing water supply systems \nwhere water is stored for irrigation, such as in ponds. \nIn the northern United States and Canada, typical \n floricane-fruiting raspberry plants require about 1 to 2 \ninches of water per week, or about 25 to 30 inches per \nseason. Demand tends to be higher in the warmer coastal \nareas. For a thirty-day drought period, or a growing \nseason with 15 inches of rainfall, an additional 10 to 15 \ninches of water would be required to meet the seasonal \ndemand. In the north, growers should store from 3 to 13 acre-inches of water for each acre irrigated during \nthe season. In the Pacific Northwest, growers should \nstore the entire seasonal demand because precipitation is minimal during the summer. An acre-inch is a unit \nof volume equal to 1 inch of water depth over an entire \nacre and is equivalent to 27,154 gallons of water.\nBecause trickle irrigation systems are not 100% effi -\ncient (they are usually around 80 to 90% efficient), the \nrule of thumb is to store 32,000 gallons of water for \nevery 1 acre-inch application. For example, a 5-inch \nseasonal demand would require 160,000 gallons per acre \nTable 6.3  Cost to pump 1 acre-foot \n(325,850 gallons) of water 1 foot in  \nelevation, assuming $0.10 per kilowatt-hour.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 4191, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fde0dd51-8d06-4b84-9c4e-b928cce4c11e": {"__data__": {"id_": "fde0dd51-8d06-4b84-9c4e-b928cce4c11e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0c3a7758-5782-4126-85cb-d5efaf1583cf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "bfd03a4b780183635198d502bd751ed1d7d9938e2c271f8f1f4939cf3bd04a3d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b67e41f0-2c7c-433d-b23b-ff046f3f9fbd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "118ae6c08a2ef3b1d15165e2ed408ac54336f06e0a5cf33381b2401c0e67facf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In the north, growers should store from 3 to 13 acre-inches of water for each acre irrigated during \nthe season.

To irrigate a 10-acre parcel, \na total of 1.6 million gallons (160,000 gallons per acre \u00d7 10 acres) should be available in storage. To store this water, a grower would have to have a 150-foot-by-150-\nfoot pond that can store water to a depth of 10 feet \n(1 cubic foot = 7.48 gallons), or have a smaller pond \nwith a rapid recharge rate.\nPeak Evapotranspiration Rate \n(Daily Peak Use Rate)\nAt some time during the growing season, environmental \nconditions and crop characteristics will demand peak \nwater-use, or peak evapotranspiration rates. The peak \nevapotranspiration (ET) rate is another useful value for \nsizing water supply systems such as continually flowing springs, streams, wells, or municipal systems. Both the water supply and the irrigation system must be capable of supplying water at the peak rate. Irrigation schedules based on the daily peak use ensure that enough water is applied when needed.\nPeak ET rates are the highest in July and August \n(table 6.4). Since these rates represent long-term and monthly averages, demand during any single day could \nbe another 25% higher, especially under hot, windy \nconditions. To use the information in table 6.4, look up \nthe location closest to the site to be irrigated, select the \npeak ET rate value, and convert it to the appropriate \nunits of interest. For example, at Harrisburg, Pennsylva -\nnia, the potential peak ET rate averages 0.22 inch per day. To irrigate 1 acre to a depth of 0.22 inch during \na twenty-four-hour period will require about 5,970 \ngallons (27,154 gallons per acre-inch \u00d7 0.22 acre-inch). \nThis will require an irrigation system that can supply \na minimum of about 4 gallons per minute (gpm) to \neach acre irrigated (5,970 gallons \u00f7 1,440 minutes per \nday), providing the system is operated for the entire \n24 hours. With the recommended drip irrigation sys -\ntem, this is an overestimate of irrigation need because \nonly the planted row is watered, not the whole field. \nIf watering is restricted to a 4 foot strip of row and \napproximately 8 feet between the row is not being \nwatered, the calculated irrigation need above would be reduced by approximately two-thirds. \nIf these values are increased 25% to account for higher \nsingle daily peak uses in the months of July and August, Table 6.4  Monthly average potential evapotrans -\npiration or peak-use rate of water (inches/day) \nfor July and August at various locations in the \nUnited States and Ontario, Canada. \nState LocationAvg Peak  \nUse Rate\nArkansas Fort Smith 0.24\nLittle Rock 0.23\nTexarkana 0.22\nCalifornia Bishop 0.45\nEureka 0.16\nFresno 0.39\nMount Shasta 0.39\nOakland 0.22\nRed Bluff 0.43\nSacramento 0.36\nSan Francisco 0.26\nStockton 0.38\nConnecticut Bridgeport 0.22\nHartford 0.21\nNew Haven 0.20\nDelaware Wilmington 0.22\nIdaho Boise 0.38\nLewiston 0.35\nPocatello 0.36\nIllinois Cairo 0.21\nChicago 0.24\nMoline 0.22\nPeoria 0.22\nSpringfield 0.23\nIndiana Evansville 0.22\nFort Wayne 0.22\nIndianapolis 0.23\nSouth Bend 0.23\nIowa Burlington 0.22\nDes Moines 0.22\nDubuque 0.21\nWaterloo 0.19\nKentucky Lexington 0.23\nLouisville 0.23\nMaine Caribou 0.17\nPortland 0.20\nMaryland Baltimore 0.25\nMassachusetts Boston 0.24\nBlue Hill Observ. 0.23\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3435, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22ed9431-d75f-40c0-9fea-c4ff1d096b03": {"__data__": {"id_": "22ed9431-d75f-40c0-9fea-c4ff1d096b03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3726a5c7-bd65-421c-82e9-fd9dc33e0f8b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "b5aa7d6b60b95aaad23f14d9cc9025186a0b882e445cc5bf88067eb8111a7100", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b639a8de-970b-4e7a-b3e2-99cd7cd8d290", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "7403667b49bcbbfdeb6f46c422f688f7c7d91577110b99c567aa7402c94f7da6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "0.23\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

Thus, a spring, stream, well, or municipal water \nsource would have to supply 4 to 5 gpm continuously \nfor each acre irrigated to meet the peak demand in the summer months.\nRound-the-clock irrigation is not always possible or \ndesirable, so growers must make the numerical adjust -\nments for the number of hours they plan to irrigate. \nFor example, if a grower wants to irrigate for only ten hours a day with a trickle irrigation system operating at \n85% efficiency, then the water supply must be capable of \ndelivering approximately 14 gpm per acre to meet the daily demand discussed in the previous paragraph.\nWater Quality\nIn most bramble production areas, water quality is gener -\nally good enough for irrigation. However, quality should \nalways be a concern when a water source is assessed. \nWater quality includes its physical, chemical, and bio -\nlogical constituents.\nPhysical constituents refer to sand, silt, or other sus -\npended materials in water. While the physical constituents \nare usually not damaging to fruit crops, they can damage \nor clog the irrigation system. For example, a high sand content damages pumps, and suspended materials can \nclog trickle systems including screens and disc filters. Carefully evaluate your pond or river water, use filter -\ning, and frequently back flush screens. A media (sand) filter works best for surface water, because it has more \ncapacity for trapping particles and the media is lifted \nduring backwash to flush the debris out.\nChemical constituents of water refer to pH, dis -\nsolved material, proportions of dissolved ions, and any \norganic compounds such as oil. Although generally \nnot a problem, organic solvents or lubricants in the \nwater can damage plants. If water pH is high (7.0 or \nabove), lower it with sulfuric acid to prevent nutritional \nproblems in the field.  Certain pesticides can be deacti -\nvated by high-pH water, so it is important to be aware of the water pH when using the irrigation system to add chemicals. In arid areas, the total dissolved solids and sodium content of the water can add to the soil \nsalinity and affect soil permeability. Saline and sodic \nsoil conditions will limit production potentials. Trickle \nirrigation systems are susceptible to clogging when large \namounts of calcium, bicarbonates, iron, manganese, \nand/or hydrogen sulfide are present.\nBiological constituents such as bacteria and algae \nare often present in surface water. They are usually \nnot harmful to fruit crops and can be controlled under \nmost circumstances, but they can affect irrigation system \nperformance, particularly trickle systems. Water con -\ntaminated with sewage should not be used to irrigate berry crops.Table 6.5  Infiltration rates \nof overhead irrigation \nfor various soil types.\nSoil Texture Infiltration \nRate \n(inches/hour)\nCoarse sand 0.75\u20131.00\nFine sand 0.50\u20130.75\nFine sandy  \nloam0.35\u20130.50\nLoam or  \nsilt loam0.25\u20130.40\nClay loam 0.10\u20130.30\n Note: Do not apply water faster \nthan the soil can absorb it, unless \nirrigating for frost protection.Table 6.7  Water-\nholding capacity of \nvarious soil types.\nSoil Type Inches \nWater/ \nInch Soil\nSand 0.02\u20130.06\nFine sand 0.04\u20130.09\nLoamy \nsand0.06\u20130.12\nSandy loam0.11\u20130.15\nLoam 0.17\u20130.23\nSilty clay loam0.14\u20130.21\nClay 0.13\u20130.18Table 6.6  Maximum irrigation period \n(hours) with trickle irrigation for various \nsoil textures, assuming 50% moisture \ncapacity at the beginning of the cycle.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3656, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b176c9ae-f1f8-4843-bbe4-9bc8de5a9e34": {"__data__": {"id_": "b176c9ae-f1f8-4843-bbe4-9bc8de5a9e34", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f9588115-0259-4786-999b-ac16e55fa77d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "4f24d405e4218d6c12ee0836e674c91e0b1e5a7bcfcd547e7dbb475349b0ea4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "50afe473-4c90-4dcc-9e04-a357c3a2abbe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "3e1d5974158680bef8f234815c565808fc9ec7f43eeed00c8d1f541e4b6ca03f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Soil Type Inches \nWater/ \nInch Soil\nSand 0.02\u20130.06\nFine sand 0.04\u20130.09\nLoamy \nsand0.06\u20130.12\nSandy loam0.11\u20130.15\nLoam 0.17\u20130.23\nSilty clay loam0.14\u20130.21\nClay 0.13\u20130.18Table 6.6  Maximum irrigation period \n(hours) with trickle irrigation for various \nsoil textures, assuming 50% moisture \ncapacity at the beginning of the cycle.\nFlow \nRate\n(gal/hr/ \n100 ft)Soil Texture\nLoamy \nsandSandy \nsandClay \nloamSilt \nloamLoam\n12 5.0 8.0 11.5 15.5 17.5\n18 3.5 5.0 7.5 10.5 11.5\n24 2.5 4.0 5.5 8.0 8.5\n30 2.0 3.0 4.5  6.5 7.0\n36 1.5 2.5 4.0  5.0 6.0\n42 1.5 2.0 3.0 4.5 5.0\n48 1.5 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.5\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

Soil \ninfiltration and water-holding characteristics (see tables \n6.5, 6.6, and 6.7) help determine the rate and dura -\ntion of water application and affect the soil\u2019s ability to \nmake water available to plants. Actual water use will \nvary daily throughout the season, so develop a method \nto make sure the crop has an appropriate amount of \nwater available. Never apply water faster than the soil can absorb it.\nSeveral methods are used to determine whether or \nnot to irrigate, some being more reliable than others. \nBy the time plants show visible signs of water deficit, \nsuch as wilting, plant growth has already been severely affected. Irrigation at this point may save the crop, but production will still suffer.\nFeel Method\nWith this method, the soil\u2019s appearance after being \nsqueezed by hand is used to estimate water content. \nWith a lot of experience, this method can be quite reli-able, and charts are available to describe how different \nsoils should look and feel at different moisture contents. \nHowever, a common mistake is to feel the surface soil layers rather than soil around the root tips, where most \nmoisture is taken up. Avoid this problem by using a \nprobe to sample soil in the crop root zone.\nWater Budget Method \nThe water-budget method is an accounting process of \ndaily water use and rainfall inputs. Plant water use is \nestimated daily based on crop development and climate conditions, and is compared to the soil\u2019s water-holding capacity. Often, pan evaporation is used to keep track of water losses. An evaporation pan is simply a pan con-taining a gauge, which calculates how much water has evaporated, and then correlates that amount with plant evapotranspiration, usually by multiplying evaporation by a factor of 1.2.\nAssume that the rooting depth of bramble crops is \n18 inches on a sandy loam, high-organic-matter soil. After a soaking rain or after irrigation, the soil should hold about 2.7 inches of water (18 inches \u00d7 0.15 from table 6.7). Irrigation should begin when available water is depleted by 50%, or about 1.4 inches in this example. \nIf evapotranspiration removes about 0.22 inches of water \nper day from the soil, then after about six days 50% of the available water is depleted and irrigation (or rain) is \nagain required. With the water-budget method, moisture \nloss is monitored and continuously calculated, and water \nis replaced based on the calculations.

It \nis important to note that applying 2 inches in a single application on sandy, well-drained soils may not be very efficient because much of the water is subject to leach -\ning from the root zone. This leaching will also carry \nnutrients such as nitrate, which is dissolved in the soil \nwater. High application rates should be avoided especially \nwhen adding nitrogen to the irrigation water.

Evaporation pans, atmometers, \ninfrared thermometers, pressure bombs, \nand porometers monitor evaporative \ndemand, plant stress, or leaf  moistu re \nstatus. Tensiometers, gypsum or ceramic \n electrical  resistance blocks, conduc -\ntivity probes, matric potential (heat-\n dissipating) sensors, neutron probes, \nand time domain reflectometry (TDR) \nprobes are used to monitor soil moisture. \nSome of these tools, such as evaporation \npans, atmometers, tensiometers, and \ngypsum blocks, are relatively inexpen-\nsive and easy to use. Others are more \nexpensive and are used mainly for research. All of them \nrequire constant monitoring, maintenance, and calibration \nto be reliable for scheduling irrigation.\nA tensiometer is a simple, inexpensive tool for mea -\nsuring soil moisture status (figure 6.3). The ceramic tip \nof the tensiometer should be placed in the rooting zone \nof the bramble plant, approximately six to ten inches \ndeep. When the reading reaches a critical level, irriga -\ntion is required. This critical level depends on soil type. Soil moisture should not be depleted below 50% of the \nsoil\u2019s capacity. Irrigation should be started when the \ntensiometer reading reaches this level, about 20 to 40 \ncentibars (cbars) in sandy soils, 40 to 60 cbars in loamy \nsoils, and 50 to 80 cbars in clay soils. Tensiometers work \nwell in sandier soils but may require more service. When \nthe soil dries out too much, there is so much vacuum \nin the tensiometer that the water column pulls apart, \nand air enters to relieve this vacuum. Servicing involves \nrefilling the tensiometer with water and extracting all \nof the air so the water column is again intact with the water in the soil.\nGypsum blocks are also inexpensive, simple to use, \nand can reflect moisture more accurately in drier soils \nthan tensiometers. Practically speaking, however, they do \nnot offer much advantage, since as mentioned previously, \nplants should be watered before soil moisture falls below \n50% of capacity. The gypsum block contains two electrodes \ncast in a small block of gypsum. The gypsum protects the electrodes from corrosion and confines the electrical path to within the block. \nA hand-held, battery-  operat ed resis -\ntance meter is connected to the wires \nto indicate the electrical resistance. The \nmore water there is in the soil (and in \nthe gypsum block), the more the cur -\nrent will flow within the gypsum block between positive and negative charges. \nGypsum blocks are sensitive to the total \ndissolved solids in the soil water so they \ncan be affected by changes in fertility. They also decompose with time, espe -\ncially in more acid soils, which may alter \nreadings over time.\nSome instruments have been devel -\noped for automated monitoring of water \nrequirements and, when integrated with \nthe appropriate irrigation system, can automate the entire \nirrigation process. More information regarding these tools \nor scheduling methods mentioned above is available in publications listed at the end of this chapter.\nTrickle Irrigation System Components \nThe water-distribution hardware for trickle irrigation \nsystems have several components, including a pumping unit, control head, mainline and submain pipes, laterals, and emitters (figure 6.4).\nPumping Unit\nThe pumping unit, which consists of a pump coupled \nto a power source, draws water from the supply source \nand pressurizes it for delivery through the irrigation \nsystem.

Consequently, pumps for \nsprinkler systems generally need to be larger than those \nfor trickle systems.\nAlthough the pumping units must meet certain \nhydraulic requirements, several options are usually avail -\nable to meet site requirements and preferences. When growers can tie into municipal or household systems, where water is already pressurized, a pumping unit is \nunnecessary. The primary concern is that the supply (vol -\nume and flow rate) is large enough. Many municipalities \nlimit the pipe size take-off to assure minimum disruption \nin pressure and flow to other users. They also generally require a flow meter and backflow prevention device.\nControl Head\nThe control head is the combination of items that con -\ntrol, measure, or treat the water. Control heads can range \nfrom simple manually operated heads with a single valve \nto quite sophisticated heads with automatic controllers \nand sensors, water meters, pressure regulators, filters, and \nnutrient or chemical injection equipment. Control heads \nfor trickle systems are often more complex than other sys -\ntems because of the necessary water filtration equipment.\nAutomated pump controllers and accessory equip -\nment can be adapted to some systems to measure soil moisture, start the irrigation system, and send water to \nthe appropriate areas. The more complex and automated \nthe control head and irrigation system, the greater the initial capital investment and maintenance costs.Mainline and Submain Pipes\nMainline and submain pipes deliver water from the \npump and control head to the laterals or other water \ndistribution equipment. These pipes are usually classified \nas permanent, rigid and portable, or flexible and portable. \nSubmain pipes are not always necessary.\nPermanent piping is usually made of galvanized steel \nor plastic (either rigid PVC or polyethylene). This piping \nis installed below ground, with the exception of steel pipe, \nwhich can be installed above ground. For perennial crops \nsuch as raspberries and blackberries, permanent buried \nmainlines with hydrants spaced throughout the field offer \nseveral advantages, but they require high initial investment.\nRigid and portable (solid-set) piping is usually made \nof lightweight aluminum equipped with quick-coupler \nfittings. Although moving pipe is labor-intensive, portable \npiping systems offer flexibility and provide irrigation at a lower initial cost.\nFlexible and portable pipe refers to conduits made with \nlightweight, durable rubber or synthetic compounds. These \npipes are generally used with self-propelled sprinklers.\nAlthough friction losses decrease per unit length from \nsteel to aluminum to plastic pipe, proper pipe diameter \nis a more important factor to minimize flow velocity \nand subsequent friction loss. Pipe size is determined \naccording to the discharge requirement, the allowable \nflow velocity within the pipe, and the trade-off between the tolerable friction loss and the total time of system \noperation in which that loss must be overcome.

A rule of thumb is that \n2-inch diameter pipe is adequate for up to 60 gpm, \n3-inch diameter for 60 to 125 gpm, 4-inch diameter for \n125 to 250 gpm, 5-inch diameter for 250 to 425 gpm, and 6-inch diameter for 425 to 675 gpm.\nPipe type (its material and whether it is permanent \nor portable) is generally not a major factor in achieving desired flow characteristics. However, the pipe strength \nor burst pressure must be high enough to withstand \nthe maximum pressure at which the irrigation system \noperates. The burst pressure of plastic pipe materials is sensitive to water temperature so the rating is the pres -\nsure at a given temperature (usually 75\u00baF). A higher \nrating may be needed for plastic pipe exposed to direct sunlight. Common ratings include 60, 80, and 100 psi for layflat and polyethylene pipe; and 160, 220, and 360 psi for PVC.\nLateral Pipes\nLateral pipes deliver water from the mainline or submain \nlines to the trickle emitters. They are of the same three \ngeneral types as the mainline pipes but are usually smaller. \nLateral pipe sizes are designed to minimize pressure losses \nso that emitter discharge at the far end of the lateral stays \nwithin 10% of the emitter discharge near the mainline to \nprovide uniform water application. Some trickle-system \nlaterals combine the functions of a lateral and an emitter; \nthese include porous pipe, row tapes, and multi-chamber \n(emitter) tubes. Lateral pipes are also rated for maximum \nor operating pressure, and row tapes come in different mil \nthicknesses. Laterals with built-in emitters are selected \nbased on the emitter spacing and desired discharge to \nmeet soil conditions and plant spacing requirements.\nEmitters\nTrickle-system emitters have very small openings, usually \npinhole size. Different emitters have different internal \nflow characteristics that determine how sensitive they are \nto pressure changes and particles in the water. A 150- to \n200-mesh screen is normally required for water filtration.\nSome emitters have larger orifices, are self-cleaning, \nor can be taken apart and cleaned. Periodic chlorine \ninjections can keep systems free of algae, bacterial slime, \nand iron precipitates. Chlorine treatment (resulting in 1 to 2 ppm residual chlorine at the emitter) should occur upstream from the filter in order to remove precipitated iron and microorganisms. This may require 5 to 10 ppm \nchlorine at the injector, especially if there are high levels \nof iron or microorganisms in the water. Swimming pool test kits can be used to calibrate the chlorine levels. If \nwater pH is above 7.5, chlorine will not be effective. \nSeparate acid injections, along with periodic flushing \nof the system, also help remove mineral buildup such \nas calcium carbonate precipitate.\nEmitters normally operate at pressures of 5 to 40 \npounds per square inch, with flow rates of 0.5 to 1.5 gal-lons per hour. Emitter spacing depends on the discharge \nrate and soil type because most of the water distribution is \nthrough the soil. The low pressure requirements of emitters \nresult in more sensitivity to pressure losses along a lateral \nline or an elevation gradient. Pressure-  compen sating emit -\nters may be necessary to achieve uniform water applica -\ntion on rolling terrain. Since the pressure and discharge requirements of emitters are usually smaller, the annual operating costs of trickle systems tend to be lower than \nthose for sprinkler systems.

It is difficult to \nget accurate nutritional recommendations for a particular \nfarm because many factors influence nutrient uptake and \navailability. For example, pH, moisture, organic matter \ncontent, clay content, and mineral composition of the \nsoil all strongly influence nutrient availability. Manage -\nment practices such as tillage, irrigation, herbicide use, \nand fertilization history also affect the plant\u2019s ability to \ntake up nutrients. Finally, weather plays a role: condi -\ntions that reduce transpiration may cause temporary \nnutrient deficiencies.

A sandy soil consists of large \nparticles and, therefore, large pores. Drainage is good, \nbut the ability to hold water and nutrients is poor. In \ncontrast, a clayey soil consists of small particles and \nsmall pores. The capacity of clay to hold water can be low as well because the amount of pore space is small. Roots also have difficulty growing through clay because of the lack of space between particles. A loamy soil (a \nmixture of sand, silt, and clay) provides a mix of pore \nsizes, some of which retain water while others provide drainage and allow oxygen to penetrate; these soils are usually best for supporting plant growth.\n 64 Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide    CHAPTER SEVEN\nSoil and Nutrient Management\nFig. 7.1  Components of soil.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

Some miner -\nals are very insoluble in water, so the associated nutrients \nmay be relatively unavailable even if they are present in \nlarge quantities. Nutrient availability is increased if soil \nparticles are small. The composition of the mineral fraction \naffects the release rate of nutrients; for example, certain \nclays have a lattice structure that traps ions between \nlayers, rendering the ions unavailable. A soil high in \nphosphates or high in pH can also reduce the availability \nof certain nutrients, such as iron and zinc. Because the chemistry governing the availability of nutrients in the soil is complex, predictions about crop response to soil type or fertilizer addition are imprecise.\nOrganic matter consists of decomposing plant mate -\nrial, animal wastes, and microorganisms. Organic mat-ter is a source of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur and \nhelps to increase the availability of positively charged \nions, such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Soils that are high in organic matter content also have a large buffering capacity, are resistant to changes in pH, and tend to have a high water-holding capacity.\nSome Basics\nOften soil contains sufficient nutrients, but they are in a \nform that is unavailable to the plant. For example, a soil may contain 25,000 parts per million (ppm) of potas-sium, but the amount available to the plant may be just \n500 ppm. Many of the factors discussed above influence \nthe conversion of mineral elements from unavailable \nforms to available forms. Soil tests attempt to estimate \nthe amount of plant-available nutrient, not the total \namount in the soil.\nNutrients are available to the plant as individual ions \nthat usually have either a positive or negative charge (table \n7.1). The behavior of nutrients in the soil is influenced \nsignificantly by this charge. For example, ammonium \n(NH\u2084+) tends to be retained by adsorption to negatively \ncharged clays and organic matter, whereas nitrate (NO\u2083\u2013) \nis more readily leached. When ammonium is taken into a root, a proton (H+) is excreted to maintain a neutral \ncharge balance. The additional hydrogen ions that result \nfrom ammonium fertilization decrease the soil pH, which \nin turn, changes the availability and uptake of plant \nnutrients. Under warm, non-acid conditions, nitrogen \ntends to be converted to the nitrate form.Some nutrients become more available at a low pH, \nothers at a high pH, and others between pH extremes \n(figure 7.2). The recommended soil pH in a bramble \nplanting in most locations is 6.0 to 6.5. Generally, in this \nrange all essential nutrients are potentially available to \nthe plant. In some sites certain micronutrients are present \nat unusually high or low levels and the optimal soil pH \nfor availability and uptake of plant nutrients may fall \noutside 6.0 to 6.5. Lime can be used to raise and sulfur used to lower pH if it is outside the desired range.\nIt is also important to understand how plants respond \nto increasing levels of a nutrient. If a particular nutrient is \nvery low, a plant will respond rapidly to increasing levels of that nutrient (figure 7.3). However, as levels continue \nto increase, the response becomes smaller and smaller \nuntil no further response can be measured. At very high \nlevels, toxicity can occur, resulting in a yield decrease. \nTherefore, it is not the case that providing additional \nnutrients will always benefit the plant. In fact, high levels \nof some nutrients reduce the availability of others.\nIf the level of a particular nutrient is low, adding a \nsmall amount often results in a growth flush. This tends to dilute the concentration of the nutrients in plant tis -\nsues, although the total amount in the plant is greater. For this reason, it is not unusual to see foliar nutrient levels fall following fertilization.\nTable 7.1  Ionic forms of plant-available \nnutrients supplied by the soil.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 4035, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19d07ea6-b4e1-489d-9250-81935d9fba25": {"__data__": {"id_": "19d07ea6-b4e1-489d-9250-81935d9fba25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "decb31c6-9fe9-452e-bde0-fa18ae840084", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "a788bec56f83e4e89cc6835a41761a7ea1185e8852ffb41bc27475931defaf1d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce2e7af2-b054-45ca-8199-1d1b6573253f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "395b2e9c5229fde6c09693275bf358d308232fdcd43786bfd08135c14faa9459", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If a particular nutrient is \nvery low, a plant will respond rapidly to increasing levels of that nutrient (figure 7.3).

Often particular combinations \nof symptoms are associated with \nspecific nutrients. The disadvantage \nof relying on visual diagnoses is that \nby the time symptoms appear, per-\nformance has already been com -\npromised. Also, it is rare that only \na single nutrient is deficient. For \nexample, if the soil pH is too high, \nthen iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), \nand zinc (Zn) become unavailable \nalmost simultaneously. Multiple \ndeficiencies make visual diagnoses \ndifficult. Finally, symptoms of toxic -\nity can sometimes resemble symp -\ntoms of deficiency. Basing fertilizer \nrecommendations on visual symp-toms alone is risky.\nSoil Tests \nSoil tests have been used for many \nyears to estimate the amounts of \nnutrients available to plants. Once \nthese numbers are known, a rec -\nommendation is made with the \nassumption that plant performance \nis related to nutrient availability. \nUsing a soil test to assess nutritional \nstatus is much better than relying \non a visual diagnosis of plant symp -\ntoms, but the test must be done \ncorrectly to ensure valid results.\nTake soil samples for testing \nfrom the top 8 inches of soil.

More than one test is required \nwhen the soil changes within the field. No more than 10 acres should be included in any one sample.\nConduct soil tests the year prior to planting. With \nthe exception of N, sufficient fertilizer and lime can be \napplied and incorporated prior to planting to meet nutri -\ntional needs over the life of the planting. In established plantings, complete soil tests every two to three years\nSoil testing laboratories use different methods to \nextract plant-available nutrients and lack consistent stan -\ndards for interpretation. For these reasons, results are not \ndirectly comparable from one laboratory to another. In addition, extractants used for estimating available P , K, \nCa, and Mg are not appropriate for estimating levels \nof micronutrients. Therefore, soil test results for most \nmicronutrients have little meaning.\nMost growers assume a higher level of precision in soil \ntests than actually exists. Soil test recommendations for berries are estimates of fertilizer needs, as crop response data for each nutrient on different soil types has not been \ngenerated. Recommendations from soil test results give a good approximate estimate of the nutrient needs, but cannot be used to fine-tune a fertilizer program.\nFoliar Analysis \nPlant tissue analysis is used to measure directly the \namount of nutrients in various plant parts. Recom -\nmendations are based on the levels of these nutrients \nat specific times of the year. In most cases, sufficiency \nranges are known for brambles or are estimated from \nother crops (table 7.2). Unlike visual diagnoses, foliar \nnutrient analyses can alert the grower when nutrient \nlevels are approaching deficiency so corrective action \ncan be taken. Unlike soil tests, foliar analyses provide \naccurate results for all essential mineral nutrients.\nCurrently, recommendations are based on newly \nexpanded leaves collected in mid-summer, usually the \nfirst week of August. Other sampling times or plant parts \nmay prove to be more appropriate for certain nutrients; \nbut until more detailed studies are done, foliar samples collected in midsummer are the standard.\nCollect at least fifty leaves from randomly selected \nprimocanes, remove their petioles, and wash them in \ndistilled water. Dry them, place them in a paper bag, and \nsend them to the laboratory for analysis. Samples should \nbe representative of the entire field. If a particular area of the field looks poor or has been fertilized differently from the rest, sample it separately.Terms Used in \nInterpreting Soil Tests\npH\u2014The relative acidity or alkalinity of a soil.

Prior to planting, conduct a soil test and \namend the soil according to recommendations. After \nplanting, conduct a foliar tissue analysis at least every \nother year. The soil pH should be monitored regularly and \na complete soil test performed every three years. Always \nbe alert for any unusual-  looking leaves and unexplained \nreductions in growth or yield.\nSoil Amendments\nMany materials are useful as soil amendments: fertilizers, \nlime, manure, composts, green manures, and others. Each \nhas unique properties that are beneficial under certain circumstances.\nLime\nLiming affects soil pH, which strongly influences nutri -\nent uptake and plant growth. Proper liming can increase \nsoil productivity and increase the \nefficiency of other fertilizers. Lime also provides Ca and possibly Mg, depending on the source. Lime is \nused to balance the acidification \nthat occurs when certain fertiliz -\ners, manures, or composts are used \n(table 7.3), or when an area receives \nextensive acid rain. Other materi -\nals may contain Ca and Mg (for \nexample, gypsum), but they do not influence soil pH significantly.\nThe proper amount of lime to \napply depends on the soil test rec -\nommendation (see \u201cSite Selection \nand Preparation,\u201d chapter two). Not \nall limestone is the same\u2014some is \nless pure than others. The purity is indicated by the calcium carbonate \nequivalent (CCE). If a particular \nlimestone has a CCE of 80%, then five tons per acre would be applied if the soil test recommended 4 tons (4 tons \u00f7 0.80 = 5 tons). Limestone \nalso differs with respect to the speed \nat which it reacts with the soil. The more finely ground the limestone, the faster it reacts, \nso particles should be smaller than a 20-mesh sieve\u2014\n preferably a 100-mesh sieve. In addition, if the soil test \nrecommends Mg, a high-Mg lime (dolomitic lime) should \nbe used, even though it may be more expensive. Finally, \nlime is sold by weight; so if the limestone is not completely \ndry, adjust application rates accordingly (that is, increase rates by the percentage of moisture in the lime).\nManure\nManure is a source of both nutrients and organic matter \nand can significantly improve soil structure. If it is readily \navailable, manure can replace some synthetic fertilizers and save the grower money.\nThe urea in manure is unstable and will volatilize \nquickly unless incorporated into the soil. The solid organic \nfraction decomposes more slowly and provides N over a long period of time\u2014even into subsequent years.

Manure spread \nin fall should be applied over a cover crop, which helps \nretain much of the N from manure that otherwise might \nbe lost to leaching and runoff.\nManure is also a source of organic P and K, but \nthese nutrients are released slowly as the organic mat -\nter decomposes. However, in a field that has received \nmanure applications over a long period of time, available \nP should be high. Growers who use manure for fertilizer \nshould monitor Mg levels closely, because manure is not \na good source of Mg.Compost\nCompost is partially broken down organic matter that \nprovides a source of nutrients and organic matter to \nplants. Because of the loss of water and carbon dioxide that occurs during the composting process, the quantity of the final product is much less than that of the raw materials, but compost materials will contain a higher concentration of N, P , and K. However, N is less avail -\nable in compost compared to manure, because less is in \nthe ammonium form and more is in the residual organic \nform. For example, whereas 35% of manure N might be available in the year the manure is spread, only 10% of the N in compost is available. \nCompost has properties that make it potentially ben -\neficial for berry growers beyond the nutrient contribution. \nCompost improves soil structure and water-holding \ncapacity, and some composts suppress diseases because \nthey have a high level of microbiological activity. Properly \ncomposted manure does not present a health hazard \nand is odor-free.\nGreen Manure \nGreen manure is a term used to describe a cover crop that is grown for the purpose of incorporation into the \nsoil. An incorporated cover crop provides organic matter, \nwhich improves soil structure and water-holding capacity. \nCover crops can also sequester residual N that is released \nfrom or applied to the soil. Green manures with a high N content (such as legumes) decompose quickly. Those with a low N content (such as cereal grains) decompose \nmore slowly, tying up N for a period of time. Berries \nshould not be planted immediately after incorporation of \na green manure, or they could experience \u201cnitrogen drag\u201d \n(see \u201cSite Selection and Site Preparation,\u201d chapter two).\nIndividual Nutrients\nNutrients are taken into the plant either actively by pref -\nerential uptake through membranes or passively through \nthe mass movement of water (containing the dissolved nutrient) into the plant (called \u201cmass flow\u201d). Nutrients \nthat are taken into the plant primarily through mass flow \nrequire adequate soil moisture to avert deficiencies.\nNitrogen (N)\nNitrogen makes up 2% to 3% of bramble plant dry matter. \nBrambles with less than 2% nitrogen in their leaves are Pathogen Contamination\nGrowers using manure should take practical steps \nto minimize the risk of pathogen spread onto \nthe berries.

Leaves begin to yellow, canes \ndo not grow vigorously, and the tips of older leaves may \nturn red. Plants with more than 3% nitrogen may be too \nvigorous and, as a result, will produce few flower buds \nand may not harden properly. Fruit firmness may also be reduced. Primocane-fruiting raspberries that will be \nmowed each spring, however, should have approximately \n3% nitrogen in their leaves. For this crop, cold tolerance is not a factor, although excessively high nitrogen levels may delay fruiting and soften fruit.\nNitrogen sources include ammonium-based fertilizers, \nnitrate fertilizers, organic sources, and organic matter \n(table 7.5). The amount of N released from organic mat -\nter can be significant. Plants tend to grow better in soils \nhigh in organic matter (greater than 6%) than those low \nin organic matter (less than 2%), even with supplemental \nN fertilization. Most commercial growers apply synthetic \nfertilizers, even when organic matter is high. This ensures \nadequate amounts of N during critical growth periods. \nNitrogen is released slowly from soil organic matter and manures, so a sufficient amount may not be available at a \ncritical time if one relies solely on organic sources. When \nadded organic matter is high in carbon, N can become temporarily unavailable. This may occur when straw or other plant residues are incorporated into soil.\nFertilizer N is available in two forms: nitrate and \nammonium. The brambles prefer nitrate N over the \nammonium form. Nitrate N is very soluble in water \nand is readily available to the plant. However, nitrate \nfertilizers are subject to leaching and are generally more expensive than ammonium fertilizers. Therefore, many \nfertilizers contain the ammonium form of N because \nit is less expensive to manufacture and soil organisms \neventually convert the ammonium form into the nitrate \nform. (Some ammonium-based fertilizers are coated with \nS or synthetic resin to further slow the release of N to \nthe plants and extend its availability, but these fertilizers \nare expensive.) Because the ammonium ion has a positive \ncharge, it tends to be adsorbed to soil colloids and is less \neasily leached.

On well-established plant -\nings, other sources of N are suitable. Many growers prefer \nammonium nitrate because it provides for both a rapid response (in the form of nitrate) and a slow release (in the form of ammonium). However, due to the potential \nexplosiveness of ammonium nitrate, it is less available \nthan in the past. Urea is usually the least expensive N \nsource, but it is subject to volatilization under certain \nconditions. If volatilization occurs, N may be lost to the air. Volatilized ammonia can blacken berry leaves close to the soil. Incorporating urea will prevent this loss.\nFoliar applications of urea are of limited value in \nbrambles. Although a significant amount of N can be absorbed through the leaves, only a small amount can be applied at any one time, usually less than 2 pounds per acre actual N.Soil tests are of limited value in \nestimating N availability, as large \nfluctuations occur from week to \nweek. Some progress is being made \nto assess N status from plant sap \nusing specific ion detectors, but the \npractical use of these tools is still \nyears away. Growers must continue \nto rely on scheduled fertilizer appli -\ncations and leaf analysis until more \nsophisticated methods are developed. \nNitrogen is more efficient when \napplications are split. Usually, the \nfirst application is made in May and \nthe second in June. See table 7.6 \nfor N fertilization recommendations \nfor raspberries. Fertilizer should not \nbe applied to brambles immediately \nafter they are planted; root systems \nare very delicate at this time and fer -\ntilizers will likely burn them. Avoid \ntouching plants with fertilizer. Rec -\nommendations are based on sandy \nloam soil with 3% organic matter \ncontent; plants growing on sandier \nsoils might require more, and plants in heavier soils with \nhigh organic matter content will require less. Cultivar, plant age, length of season, cultural practices, and mois -\nture status can also vary nitrogen requirement. Adjust \napplication rates up or down depending on the results of \na mid-summer leaf analysis. Nitrogen deficiency results in smaller plants with older leaves displaying a reddish color. Symptoms are most apparent in late summer.\nPhosphorus (P)\nThe total amount of P in soil averages about 900 pounds \nper acre across all soil types, but only a fraction is avail -\nable for plant growth. Much of the P is tied up in soil \nminerals, insoluble precipitates, and organic matter. Little \nP is dissolved in the soil solution, so most uptake occurs through diffusion. Good root growth is required for a plant to obtain an adequate surface area to facilitate P \nuptake. Berries tend to have a low demand for P relative \nto other crops. Only a small percentage of commercial fields are deficient in P; in most cases, excess P is more of a concern.Table 7.6  Nitrogen guidelines for raspberries.\nAge of \nPlanting\n(years)Amount/Timing \n(actual N)N Source Comments\nSummer-bearing\n025-35 lb/A\n4 weeks after plantingcalcium \nnitrateAvoid touching plants \nafter planting with \nfertilizers.\n1 35-55 lb/A\nMay or split between \nMay and Juneurea, \nammonium \nnitrateUse higher amount \non sandier soils or if \nirrigation is used.\n2+ 40-80 lb/A\nMay or split between \nMay and Juneurea, \nammonium \nnitrateUse higher amount \non sandier soils or if \nirrigation is used.\nFall-bearing\n025 lb/A\n4 weeks after planting \nand in Augustcalcium \nnitrateAvoid touching plants \nafter planting with \nfertilizers.\n150-80 lb/A\nsplit between May and \nJuneurea, \nammonium \nnitrateUse higher amount \non sandier soils or if \nirrigation is used.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 3911, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d91ee861-0db3-4724-bca8-1e3960732b36": {"__data__": {"id_": "d91ee861-0db3-4724-bca8-1e3960732b36", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1f391968-8377-431e-9c8e-423503402acb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "3fe1b41b4467f547d935160c14017390eb62c16b12e75b09855bbc379ac4fe80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e69c553c-6b0f-4812-8d2b-d6726d1212f2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "30de00667fa07f828ece14a415fa8501e3440e92947d7dec6d15d46646990087", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "1 35-55 lb/A\nMay or split between \nMay and Juneurea, \nammonium \nnitrateUse higher amount \non sandier soils or if \nirrigation is used.\n2+ 40-80 lb/A\nMay or split between \nMay and Juneurea, \nammonium \nnitrateUse higher amount \non sandier soils or if \nirrigation is used.\nFall-bearing\n025 lb/A\n4 weeks after planting \nand in Augustcalcium \nnitrateAvoid touching plants \nafter planting with \nfertilizers.\n150-80 lb/A\nsplit between May and \nJuneurea, \nammonium \nnitrateUse higher amount \non sandier soils or if \nirrigation is used.\n2+70-100 lb/A\nsplit between May and \nJuneurea, \nammonium \nnitrateUse higher amount on \nsandier soils or if irriga -\ntion is used.

Excess P fertilization can result in micronutri-ent deficiencies.\nPhosphorus availability is affected by soil pH, soil \nmoisture, soil type, organic matter content, the amount of Ca and Al in the soil, and soil temperature. Extremes \nin pH, temperature, and moisture can limit availability, as \ncan excessive Ca and Al. Soils with a large quantity of clay \nwill fix more P than lighter soils. Certain microorganisms \ncan increase P availability, including phosphobacteria \nand some mycorrhizal fungi. Humic acids from organic \nmatter decomposition increase the solubility of P . Avail -\nable P is increased after incorporating a green manure, even when no additional P has been added.\nBecause inorganic P has a low solubility in water, it is \nnot subject to leaching. However, it must be incorporated \nto be effective. Phosphorus fertilizers (table 7.7) applied \nto the soil surface will not move into the root zone within \na useful time period. Preplant incorporation is necessary. \nLarge granules of fertilizers are slow to break down, so \nfor maximum effectiveness, uniformly distribute small \ngranules throughout the root zone. Keep soil pH near 6.5 to ensure that P is available.\nPhosphorus can be applied though a drip irrigation sys -\ntem in the form of phosphoric acid. Materials  contai ning P are incompatible with many other fertilizers. Use cau-\ntion when applying through a drip irrigation system.\nPlants deficient in P develop a purplish cast in older \nleaves. Younger leaves may turn dark green. Foliar P \nlevels tend to decline after fruiting. If P levels are low, then apply 100 pounds per acre in a form that is readily available to the plant (table 7.7).\nPotassium (K)\nBrambles have a relatively high demand for K, as it is \na component of fruit. Much more K is present in the \nsoil than is available to the plant. For example, soils may \naverage 25,000 ppm, but the concentration in the soil \nsolution may be only 10 ppm. Soil tests estimate the \namount of K on exchange sites, which is also available \nfor plant uptake. This amount is variable but can be \nup to 600 ppm. Since little K is dissolved in solution, diffusion is the most important mechanism of uptake. \nTherefore, good root development is essential to increase \nthe surface area through which the K can diffuse.\nThe availability of K is very dependent on soil chem -\nistry. The amount of organic matter, the soil texture, \nthe type of clay, and the mineral base also influence \navailability.

A balance among these three cations is necessary for proper nutrition.\nPreplant incorporation of K (table 7.5) is most effec -\ntive, while fertigation can be used to supply K in estab -\nlished plantings. Surface applications of K fertilizers are of \nlimited value for short-term crops such as brambles. Foliar \nuptake is possible, although the total amount that can be \nsupplied through this method in a single application is \nsmall. Sequential applications are effective but expensive.\nPotassium is required for many physiological processes \nin the plant, including enzyme activation, transport of \nsugars, stomatal functioning, charge balance, protein \nsynthesis, and photosynthesis. Deficiencies occur on older \nleaves first and result in marginal necrosis. Potassium \nlevels in leaves tend to fluctuate during the season and decrease as crop load increases. If foliar levels are low, \nthen supplemental K can be added with the amount \ndependent on soil type. The maximum amount of K \nthat one should apply in any year is 250 pounds per \nacre; in a heavier soil, half that amount. Fall application is desirable. Excess K can induce a Mg deficiency, so if \nthe K/Mg ratio exceeds 4, then additional Mg should be \napplied if K is also applied. Potassium sulfate or potas -\nsium magnesium sulfate are the best sources of potassium \nfor brambles. Although muriate of potash (potassium \nchloride) is less expensive, brambles are sensitive to the chloride in this fertilizer if the application rate is high (>500 lb/A).\nSulfur (S)\nSulfur occurs in elemental form, as well as in sulfides, sulfates, and organic combinations with carbon and N. \nThe majority of S comes from decomposing organic \nmatter, although a significant amount is dissolved in rain, \nup to 100 pounds per acre annually. Most is absorbed by \nmass flow. Because S availability is associated with carbon \nand N cycling, large annual variations occur, giving soil tests limited value under most conditions.\nSulfur is an essential component of proteins; when S is \ndeficient, overall plant vigor is decreased and leaves turn \na reddish color. In the north, S has not been considered problematic, especially since the region gets more than its share of acid rain.The major use of S for berry growers is for pH reduc -\ntion. If soils are too alkaline, the addition of S will lower \nthe pH. Sulfur is oxidized by bacteria into sulfuric acid, \nwhich helps to neutralize basic ions such as Ca and \nMg. The size of S granules is the major factor influenc-ing the rate of soil pH change. After ninety days, only about 1% of the S will react if the granules are unable to pass through a 10-meshes-per-inch screen (0.2 inch in diameter), whereas nearly half will react if the size is less than 100 meshes per inch.\nCalcium (Ca) \nCalcium is a major component of pectin, the strength -\nening agent of cell walls. Without sufficient Ca, fruit \nare soft, and leaf tips turn brown and do not completely \nexpand. In severe cases, plants turn brown and new leaves \ndevelop interveinal necrosis.\nSymptoms of Ca deficiency are common, but this is \nrarely due to insufficient Ca in the soil. Ca mobility is \nlimited, both in the soil and in the plant, and the fac -\ntors affecting mobility indirectly influence Ca uptake. \nCalcium can enter the plant only through unsuberized root tips\u2014not along the entire length of root. Therefore, \nfactors that limit mass flow, such as low soil moisture and \ncool, cloudy, humid weather, can reduce the amount of Ca \nentering the plant to below critical levels. Since Ca move -\nment within the plant is also limited, deficiencies occur in new growth at points farthest from the root system.\nAdequate Ca is usually present if the soil pH is within \nan acceptable range. With drip irrigation, Ca can be \nleached out of the wetted zone over time. In most cases, though, maintaining good soil moisture is the best way to prevent tip burn associated with Ca deficiency.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 4184, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2da5981-4ceb-4bf2-b308-c2ffd6ae7d58": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2da5981-4ceb-4bf2-b308-c2ffd6ae7d58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "92001855-9784-4508-8efe-7c59eeb050ab", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "e7a042d161dc0d0f8e19b2462dcc42136fb8ee6135ef2d9b2ce3e0aa1aa60b5e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f65b14b5-bf8a-4a71-b9f8-c6c0cea13506", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "1c6f777ae82d459c47959bb0fd00b06db0619554e0b3ce78591ea3e5938e064e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Ca mobility is \nlimited, both in the soil and in the plant, and the fac -\ntors affecting mobility indirectly influence Ca uptake. \nCalcium can enter the plant only through unsuberized root tips\u2014not along the entire length of root.

Cold, wet, cloudy weather induces \nMg deficiency in marginal situations, since uptake is \nmainly by mass flow. \nMagnesium availability increases with soil pH up to \n8.5 (figure 7.2, page 66). Magnesium can be relatively \nunavailable at a low pH. Also, high levels of Al can reduce \nMg availability, and excessive K can induce Mg deficiency. \nA K/Mg ratio of less than 5 is desirable. If this ratio is \nhigh, additional Mg could be beneficial even if Mg is within the desired range. Since Mg is fairly soluble, it \ncan be effectively applied to leaves (depending on the \nformulation, at 5 pounds actual Mg per acre) or to the soil surface (at 40 pounds per acre). Apply in fall after \nplants are dormant. The least expensive source of Mg \nis dolomitic lime, but it must be incorporated prior to planting. A soluble form is magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) at 20% Mg.\nIron (Fe) \nIron is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth\u2019s crust, but concentrations in soils vary widely. Much of \nthe Fe in soil is in the insoluble ferric form (Fe 3+), which \nis unavailable to plants. Available Fe in the ferrous form \n(Fe2+) is obtained from clays, minerals, and hydroxides. \nRoot exudates, microbial byproducts, and organic matter \nare natural chelates that can increase Fe availability up to threefold.\nIron becomes more available with decreasing soil pH. \nExcessive liming can induce an Fe deficiency. Excess P \ncan form insoluble precipitates with Fe. Nitrogen sources \nalso affect Fe availability. Fertilization with ammonium sources of N tends to decrease soil pH around the root zone, thereby increasing Fe availability.\nRarely is an iron-containing, soil-applied fertilizer \nrequired to relieve a deficiency. Acidification of soil is \nthe most cost-effective way to increase Fe availability. \nIf plants are deficient, then foliar applications are useful during the time when soil pH is being lowered. Formu -\nlations vary, so follow the label directions.\nManganese (Mn)\nManganese is widely distributed in northeastern soils. \nWith the exception of the mid-Atlantic coastal plain, \nfew soils are inherently low in this nutrient. However, \nacross the United States, Mn is the most commonly \ndeficient micronutrient. Manganese availability is strongly  associated with soil pH, and deficiencies most often occur \non alkaline soils or on soils that have been heavily limed. \nIn some soils, toxicity can occur if the pH is too low. \nIf Mn is deficient, soil pH should be lowered to below 6.5. Foliar sprays may temporarily relieve a deficiency, \nwhich is characterized by generally poor growth without \ndistinguishing symptoms.\nBoron (B) \nBoron is the only nonmetal among the micronutrients \nand usually does not occur as a charged ion. This, coupled \nwith its small size, makes it especially prone to leaching. \nIn coarse-textured soils that are low in organic matter, up to 85% of the available B can be leached with only 5 inches of water. The level of B in soil varies widely, so \nB is one of the most commonly deficient micronutrients \nin berry plantings. Furthermore, soils naturally low in B occur throughout the United States and Canada.\nBoron is essential for root growth. If root growth \nis poor, deficiencies of other nutrients can develop and \nplants become stunted. Foliar levels tend to decline during \nthe season. If a foliar analysis indicates 30 ppm B or less \nearly in the season, levels may be inadequate to sustain the \nplants through fruiting. To supplement soil B, apply no \nmore than 1 pound of actual B per acre per year. Uptake \noccurs through leaves and roots, so the best time to apply \nB is prior to fruiting in primocane-fruiting brambles \nand mid-summer for other types. Blending granular B with other fertilizers makes application easier. A foliar application might consist of 2 pounds per acre soluble boron (20% B) in 100 gallons of water.\nMass flow is the most important mode of uptake for \nB, so conditions not favoring water uptake may induce a deficiency.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4059, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab8ab04b-0c44-4c4d-80d3-ab8897ec0419": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab8ab04b-0c44-4c4d-80d3-ab8897ec0419", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "47894fb1-dbf6-4f62-b2e2-d0597b9f1a88", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "9fda7741b6015aadfd5e67422a287d8b082c06e0fa60443cc450185c0fbfde2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "12fa3d6c-5c95-4536-9888-97cb8c1c493c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "2fa6c5149b76d519027fd8eb4f6eab86408acfd4107eea6c3ba5254052487c06", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If root growth \nis poor, deficiencies of other nutrients can develop and \nplants become stunted.

Zinc availability \nincreases as soil pH decreases, so avoiding excessively \nhigh pH can help prevent deficiencies.\nZinc is relatively immobile in the soil, so preplant \napplications such as zinc sulfate, although effective, can \nbe expensive. Soil surface applications are not effective. \nFertigation also may be an effective way to increase \nplant Zn levels.\nCopper (Cu)\nCopper is one of the least mobile nutrients in soil or \nplants. For this reason, when Cu is deficient, corrections are difficult. Although a significant amount of soil Cu is \ninsoluble, a significant pool may be complexed with natural \norganic chelates. This pool is available for plant uptake.\nOnly small areas of North America contain soils \nthat are inherently low in Cu. However, high soil pH \nand excessive P , Zn, and Al restrict Cu absorption and \ntranslocation. Furthermore, Cu adsorption to Fe, Al, \nand Mn oxides can be significant. The dynamics of Cu in the soil are very complex.\nVisual symptoms of Cu deficiency are not distinc -\ntive, although Cu is an essential component of many \nenzyme systems. Foliar levels above 7 ppm are considered \nadequate, but no response to applications have been \nreported when levels are above 3 ppm.\nCopper is toxic to both roots and leaves, so reme -\ndial action can cause more harm than good.

The disadvantages \nof synthetic fertilizers are that they often have a high \nsalt index (they can burn the plant), they are subject \nto leaching, and they may contain chlorides, which are \ntoxic at high levels. Fertilizers should be used spar -\ningly in young plantings because of sensitivity to salts. \nCalcium nitrate is recommended on first-year plantings \nas a N source, especially if the field was fumigated \nbefore planting. If more than 100 pounds per acre of \nK is required, potassium sulfate is recommended over potassium chloride to avoid chloride toxicity.\nMany fertilizers tend to acidify the soil, so if large \namounts are applied, additional lime may be necessary to buffer against pH changes (table 7.3). Fertilizers are available that contain micronutrients (table 7.9), but in many cases, micronutrients become fixed in soil and are \nunavailable to the plant shortly after application. For \nthis reason, chelates and fertigation are the preferred \napplication methods for micronutrients.\nChelated Nutrients\nChelate is derived from a Greek word meaning claw and \nis used to describe metallic cations complexed to large organic molecules. Complexed ions are protected from \nreaction with inorganic constituents that would make them unavailable for uptake by plants. Plant roots exude \nchemicals that act as chelates. Chelates can result from \nthe breakdown of organic matter, or they can be syn -\nthesized. Zinc, Cu, Mn, and Fe are among the essential \nplant micronutrients that form chelates with organic \nmolecules.\nChelates vary in their stability and suitability as \nsources of micronutrients. Under most conditions, Fe \nchelates are more stable than those of Zn and Cu, which \nin turn are more stable than Mn chelates. This is because \nFe has a higher affinity for chelates. If Cu chelate is \nadded to a soil high in Fe, the Fe may displace the Cu, \nrendering the Cu subject to soil reactions. Therefore, \nthe ability of chelates to increase nutrient availability depends on the level of other available cations. With foliar applications, the organic chelates are less reactive and cause less phytotoxicity. However, because of their large size, their movement into a leaf is more limited than with inorganic salts.\nFertigation\nFertigation is often the most effective way of providing \nnutrients to berries (table 7.9). Applications can be more \nuniform than with ground equipment and can be made \nduring any weather. Less fertilizer is usually required \nas well. Disadvantages include the capital expense and \ntime to set up and calibrate the system. The potential \nfor leaching is greater with fertigation, and it is highly \nregulated by most states. Drip irrigation systems are \nsusceptible to plugging if improper fertilizer materials are used. Although little is known about fertigation for perennial berry crops, an increasing number of growers are finding it worthwhile to install a fertigation system and experiment on their own. \nThe amount of fertilizer to apply is dependent on \nmany factors, but a starting point is 8 pounds per acre \nactual N per week between early May and mid-  Septem ber \nof the planting year, and 5 pounds per acre actual N per \nweek between mid-July and mid-September of the fruit -\ning year assuming granular fertilizer was applied in the spring. Other nutrients can be added if a leaf analysis indicates the need.\nIf fertigation is to be used, consider water quality and \nuniformity of water application by the system.

Harmful insects \nand mites attack the fruit, buds, leaves, and roots of the bramble plant, and in some cases, transmit plant disease (e.g., aphids). They can also increase the susceptibility of damaged plants to other pests or environmental stresses. \nThe grower\u2019s objective should be to minimize damage \nfrom harmful insects while preserving beneficial insects. \nThis chapter is designed to familiarize growers with \nthe biology of bramble insects and mites, to help growers \nidentify the damage pests cause, and to briefly outline \nways growers can control pests. Emphasis is on cultural \ncontrols, since regulations and restrictions concerning \npesticide use are continually changing and vary from \nstate to state.

Although a majority of flowers can be sufficiently \npollinated without bees, bees are essential for the berries \nto reach their full size potential and achieve a good shape. \nPartially pollinated berries are small, crumbly, and tend to be misshaped as druplets fail to develop. \nMany bee species are capable of pollinating bramble \nflowers, and most of these species occur in the wild. \nBramble plants produce large amounts of nectar, making \nthem attractive to wild bees and reducing their need for managed bees if wild populations are sufficiently large. \nIf managed bees are needed, honey bees are the most \ncommonly used for field grown bramble crops. One or two strong hives per acre are sufficient to provide for the \npollination needs of brambles. A brood nest that spans five or six frames is optimal. \nPlace hives off of the ground, east-facing, in an area \nthat receives maximum sunlight. Windbreaks near the hive are helpful. Do not allow grass to grow up around the hives. Avoid spraying nearby fields with pesticides while the bees are present, and avoid using highly toxic pesticides within a week of introducing the bees (table \n8.1, page 80). Before introducing the bees, mow the \nfield to eliminate competing flowers and thus further \nencourage the bees to visit the berry crop. Keep an ample \nsupply of fresh water near the hive.\nSome growers maintain areas near their fields exclu -\nsively for native and feral bees. The bees forage and nest in these sites and are available for the pollination needs of fruits and vegetables.\n   8: Insect and M ite Scouting and Management  79CHAPTER EIGHT\nInsect and Mite  \nScouting and Management\nFig. 8.1  Bee pollination of raspberry flower. \nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

In \nearly May, the adults feed on the young leaves, skeleton -\nizing the foliage (figure 8.5). As the leaf and fruit buds \ndevelop, the beetles feed on them, producing holes, which \nhinder fruit development. Later, the small larvae feed \ninside the flower buds and then bore into the young \nfruits, which may dry up or decay and fall off. The larvae \ncan be found lying between the berry and its receptacle, \nand may remain with the berry after it is picked.\nBecause fruitworm larvae fall to the ground by the \nend of July, fall-fruiting brambles often escape injury. \nCultivation of plant rows during late summer and early fall may kill the larvae and pupae in the soil; however, \nmost commercial operations rely on chemical control. \nInsecticide sprays should be applied (1) early pre-bloom \nas blossom buds appear and (2) late pre-bloom just before \nblossoms open. Sprays applied for fruitworm control \nshould also control the sawfly, described below.Raspberry Sawflies\nScientific names: Monophadnoides geniculatus Hartig \nThe adults are small, black, thick-bodied insects about \n\u00bc inch long and appear about the time the leaves begin to \nunfold in early May (table 8.2).

They either feed near the \nsurface or they bore into the fruit where they can be \nfound next to the receptacle.\nBecause these beetles are attracted to injured and \noverripe fruit, control of other fruit-damaging pests and \nprompt harvesting of ripe berries can help in reducing \ndamage caused by this pest. Raspberry cultivars that \nmature fruit later in the season tend to be more vul -\nnerable to this insect. Remove harvested fruit from the field or cover it to prevent post-harvest contamination. Abundance of organic debris in neighboring fields may contribute to greater populations of sap beetles in the \narea. If necessary, sprays should be applied as fruit begins \nto color or as soon as beetles are seen.\nTarnished Plant Bug\nScientific name: Lygus lineolaris Palisot de Beauvois\nTarnished plant bug adults are about \u00bc inch long, oval, \nsomewhat flattened, and greenish-brown with  reddish-\nbrown markings on the wings (figure 8.11). A distin -\nguishing characteristic is a small, yellow-tipped triangle \non the back, behind the head. Nymphs are pale green \nwhen they first hatch and are very small, less than 1\u204416 inch \nlong. Later, nymphal instars (a stage between molts) are successively larger, often brown in color, and have wing pads. Older nymphs have a characteristic pattern of five spots on their back (figure 8.12).\nTarnished plant bugs overwinter as adults and become \nactive from late April to mid-May when they lay eggs \nin crop and weed hosts (figure 8.13). After hatching, \nnymphs feed on flowers and developing fruit. These \nnymphs molt to the adult stage by early summer, and the \ncycle is repeated; two to four generations occur annually \n(table 8.2, page 81).\nFeeding by tarnished plant bugs on buds, blossoms, \nqFig. 8.6  Rasp-\nberry sawfly egg. \n \nsFig. 8.7   \nRaspberry \nsawfly larva.\nqFig. 8.8   \nRaspberry leaf damage caused by raspberry sawfly larva.\nFig. 8.9  Sap \nbeetle adult. \nFig. 8.10  Sap beetle adult \non raspberry. \nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

As adults, they usually have two dark spots, one on each side of their bodies (figure 8.16). The \nmites are barely visible to the unaided eye. Adults or late \ninstar nymphs overwinter at the base of \nbrambles or weeds. After moving onto the foliage, the adults lay eggs on the undersides of the leaves, which are the \nprime feeding areas of young and adult \nmites. As many as ten generations per year can occur (table 8.2, page 81).\nMite feeding on leaf undersides first \ncauses a fine gray or white stippling on \nthe upper leaf surfaces (figure 8.17). \nLater, discolored blotches develop, web -\nbing produced by the mites is apparent, \nqFig. 8.11  \nTarnished plant bug adult on raspberry. \nFig. 8.1 4\u0003 p \nDamaged fruit from \ntarnished plant bug.\nqFig. 8.12  \nTarnished plant bug nymph (late instar) on raspberry. \nFig. 8.15p \nUndamaged ( left) \nand damaged ( right) \nblackberries from \ntarnished plant bug.\nqFig. 8.13 \n Tarnished plant bug egg on raspberry leaf. \nFig. 8.16  Adult (left) \nand immature ( right) \ntwo-spotted spider mites.

Older, less succulent leaves appear to be preferred by the mites, and injury is less serious on more \nvigorous plants. Damage is first seen and is more prevalent \nin drier areas of a field, and is more likely to occur during \nhot, dry seasons. Areas with mild growing seasons most frequently have mite problems.\nSevere foliage injury to the fruiting spurs reduces the \nyield and quality of fruit during the current season. Feed -\ning on primocane foliage stunts cane growth for the next \nyear\u2019s fruit production, and because leaves are removed early, the canes are susceptible to winter injury. During \ncertain seasons, the mites become so abundant that they \nswarm on the berries at harvest, resembling brown dust, and decrease the market value of the fruit.\nNaturally occurring predatory mites can maintain \nspider mite populations at low levels, especially in fields not routinely sprayed with broad-spectrum insecticides \n(see table 8.3). In addition, researchers and practitioners \nare currently testing releases of predatory mites in an \neffort to control two-spotted mites in brambles. These \ncan be ordered from commercial suppliers. Generally, \npredatory mites should be released prior to the onset \nof severe foliar symptoms. Miticide sprays are applied as the mite density on the leaf increases. Several sprays \nmay be necessary, and thorough underleaf coverage is \nessential for good control.\nRose Chafer\nScientific name: Macrodactylus subspinosus Fabricius\nThe rose chafer beetles overwinter as larvae deep in \nthe soil and migrate upward in the spring, pupating in \nearly May. The adult is slender, long-legged, light  grayis h-\nbrown, and about \u00be inch long (figure 8.18). Adults emerge \nfrom the soil in late May and early June. Feeding,  mating , \nand egg-laying takes place into early July. The eggs are deposited singly, a few inches below the soil surface. \nHatching takes place two weeks after oviposition (egg \nlaying), and the larvae (grubs) feed on grass and weed \nroots until cold weather, when they migrate deeper into the soil to overwinter (table 8.2, page 81).\nAdults feed on leaves and blossoms in June and July. \nLight, sandy soil can promote high populations that \ncan strip the plants. Larvae feed mainly on the roots of grasses and weeds, and do not damage brambles.\nChemical control is generally recommended. Sprays \nshould be applied upon appearance of the beetles and/or \ndamage.\nJapanese Beetle\nScientific name: Popillia japonica Newman\nAdults are about \u00bd inch long and shiny metallic green \n(figure 8.19).

The winter is spent as partially grown larvae. \nGrowth and feeding continues in the spring. Pupation begins in June, with adult emergence following later in the month.\nThese beetles are serious pests of lawn, turf, vegetables, \nand nursery stock. Bramble plantings near turf may be especially susceptible to infestation. Beetles chew small \nholes in the fruit, which may then be more susceptible to \ndiseases, particularly fruit rots. Sometimes the beetles may \nreach numbers high enough to cause leaf damage. Beetles \nare sometimes active before the fruit ripens, and as a result, \nthe first damage noticed is skeletonization of the foliage.\nA chemical spray may be needed at late pre-bloom, \njust before the blossoms open. Japanese beetles can con -\ntinue to cause problems during and after bloom. However, \nit is much more difficult to avoid killing pollinators \nduring this time.\nAphids\nScientific names: Amphorophora agathonica  and Aphis \nrubicola\nThe two aphid pest species of brambles are (1) the \nlarge raspberry aphid, Amphorophora agathonica  (figure \n8.20), and (2) the small raspberry aphid, Aphis rubicola. \nThey are both light green to yellow in color.\nAphids overwinter as eggs and hatch in May. Females, which may be winged or wingless, give birth to live young \nthroughout the summer. A number of generations may be produced. Males are produced in the fall and mate with females to produce the overwintering eggs.\nAphids are most important to bramble growers as \ntransmitters of viral diseases, particularly in nurseries. \nRaspberry mosaic virus is transmitted by the large rasp -\nberry aphid, and raspberry leaf curl virus is transmitted by the small raspberry aphid.\nAll infected plantings must be removed and destroyed. \nNew planting stock should be aphid-resistant cultivars that are certified virus-free. Also, a distance of at least 500\u20131,000 feet should be kept between new plantings and virus-infected plantings. Windbreaks between new plantings and wild brambles may hinder aphid move -\nment. Special sprays can be applied to nursery stock to control aphids.\nBlackberry Leafminer\nScientific name: Metallus rubi Forbes\nThe adult, a sawfly, emerges and lays eggs throughout \nJune. After hatching, the larvae feed inside the leaf tissue \n(figure 8.21). When mature, they drop to the soil and \npupate, usually in August. Second-generation adults are \nactive from mid-August to mid-September, during which \ntime they lay eggs. The hatched larvae feed in the leaves (figure 8.22), then drop to the ground where they over -\nwinter. Pupation occurs in the spring, and adults emerge again in June. The larvae tunnel through leaf tissue and create \u201cmines\u201d that cause affected areas to turn brown.\nThis is a sporadic pest that can sometimes cause \nextensive leaf injury.

Cultivars may differ in suscepti -\nbility (although more work in this area is needed). Adults \nand nymphs feed along the veins on the undersides of \nleaves by sucking up plant juices. In the feeding process, they apparently inject with their saliva a toxic substance that causes plugs to form in the vascular system of the plant. Margins of affected leaves develop a light yellow \ncolor, and new growth can be curled downward and \nstunted (figure 8.26). Potato leafhopper injury may be \nmistaken for herbicide damage, nutrient deficiency, or \nsymptoms of viral infection.\nThe adult leafhopper is bright green and about \u215b \ninch long (figure 8.27). It takes flight quickly when \ndisturbed, so sweep-nets are used to catch and identify \nthem. Young nymphs are smaller and light green and \nare easily identified by their habit of moving sideways when disturbed. Females deposit eggs within leaves and stems of plants, and nymphs develop on the undersides of leaves. Nymph activity is greatest from late spring to \nmidsummer. Adult leafhoppers are highly mobile, migrat -\ning from the southern to northern states each year. The wide host range of this insect, nearly 140 plant species, \nfacilitates the annual migration.

The long, black antennae are easily noticed (figure 8.28).\nThese insects require two years to complete their life \ncycle. The adults appear in raspberry plantings in early \nJune and may be present until late August. They feed \non the tender, green epidermis of cane tips and leave \nbrownish patches or scars.

They \nfeed along leaf edges and can be most easily found on \nsunny days. Females deposit whitish, scale-like eggs along \nthe bark of new growth in May and June. After hatching, \nthe larvae construct long, winding tunnels which spiral around the cane several times in the sapwood, turn into \nthe hardwood, and then end in the pith. A swelling usu -\nally develops where the tunneling occurs and is apparent \nby July or August (figure 8.34). Once the tunnel reaches \nthe pith, it straightens into a path through the pith. The larva is full-grown by fall, remains in the tunnel during the winter, and pupates in the spring. Adults emerge in the summer (table 8.4).\nThe presence of these borers is indicated by a sym -\nmetrical swelling \u00bc to 3 inches long on the cane. These swellings occur between 1 and 4 feet above the ground; \nthose nearer the ground cause more damage. The affected \ncane is usually broken or severed near the swelling where \nthe spiraling tunnels have weakened it. Many weak-\ncaned cultivars of raspberries wither and die before the fruit matures.\nInjured canes should be removed and burned during \nthe dormant season. Insecticides are directed at adults only, and are applied at late pre-bloom just before blos -\nsoms open.\nRaspberry Cane Maggot\nScientific name: Pegomya rubivora Coq.\nThe adult resembles a housefly, but is smaller. The \nmaggot (larva) burrows into the pith (figure 8.35), then tunnels down the cane, later working toward the bark and gradually girdling the cane from the inside.\nInjury caused by the maggot resembles that of the raspberry cane borer\u2014new tips wilt, dry up, and die. \nHowever, unlike cane borer damage, no girdling marks \nappear. Tunneling produces a swelling of the stem which \ncauses the plant to die above the injury (figure 8.36).

After hatching, the larva moves to \nthe cane base where it either excavates a cavity in which to overwinter or finds a protected place in the bark. The \nnext spring, the larva (figure 8.39) enters the crown \nand also the roots, but it usually tunnels into a new \ncane and girdles it before returning to the root tissue \n(figure 8.40). The second winter is spent in the roots. \nBy the second summer, the crown can be extensively \ndamaged. The larva transforms into a pupa by August \nof the second summer, and the adult emerges shortly \nthereafter (table 8.4, page 88).\nDamage from this serious pest is often confused \nwith disease symptoms. The first indication of injury is the withering, wilting, and dying of the cane foliage, often with half-grown fruit still attached. If damaged \ncanes are pulled the second summer, they will break \noff at the damaged area, sometimes revealing the larva inside. Such injury to the canes may increase the inci -\ndence of diseases.\nWorkers in New England have seen swelling in the \ncrown, and the entire plant with all its canes may be \nkilled. Damage to the roots and crown is more difficult to find because the plants must be dug up to verify the cause (figure 8.41). Damage by this pest is indicated by girdled crowns and canes, and burrowed cavities inside \nthe crowns. The crown must be opened to find the dam -\naging larva.\nDuring the growing season, dying canes and any oth -\ners showing symptoms of infestation should be destroyed. \nAll wild brambles in the area should be eliminated. \nInsecticides are applied as a heavy drench in the early \nspring to kill larvae, and as a spray between mid-October \nand mid-November to kill adults. \nTree Crickets\nScientific name: Oecanthus spp.\nThe tree cricket is a delicate-looking, greenish-white, \nslender-bodied insect (figure 8.42). It has dark antennae, \nwhich are usually longer than its body. During the sum -\nmer, both nymphs and adults can be found on bramble canes (table 8.4). In late summer, females lay eggs in the \ncanes, leaving several small punctures very close together \nand arranged in rows lengthwise on the cane (figure \n8.43). There may be only a few punctures or up to 50 in a row. These rows are usually 2 to 3 inches long and may be anywhere on the cane, but are most common within 2 feet of the tip. Tree crickets have one generation per year, overwintering as eggs.\nThe punctures created by the female weaken the cane, \ncausing it to split or break at the point of injury.

Its mouthparts are extended into a snout (figure 8.44). Adults of the three species of root weevils range in length from 2\u204410 to 4\u204410 inch. They \nemerge from pupal chambers in the soil from late May through June, and feed on foliage at night. After 10\u201360 days, they begin to lay eggs in the soil. Upon hatching, the C-shaped larvae (grubs) (figure 8.45) feed on roots \nthroughout the summer and overwinter in the soil. They \nstart  feeding again in the spring, pupate, and emerge as \nadults during the summer.\nThese insects are important pests in strawberries, but \ncan also cause damage to bramble plantings. The pres -\nence of adults is shown by notches in the leaves, but this \ndamage is seldom important. The real damage is caused by larvae which tunnel in the roots and crowns, thereby weakening, stunting, or killing the plant.\nFew chemical spray options are effective. Maintain-\ning weed-free plantings is an important practice for \npreventing egg-laying by adults. Soil fumigation, non-\nhost rotation, and cultivation are effective as preplant \ncontrol measures. Since the beetles cannot fly, place \nnew plantings at least 1,000 feet from infested plant -\nings, and avoid transporting weevils on equipment or \nplant material. Entomopathogenic nematodes have been \nshown to provide some control against root weevils in \nstrawberries, but have not been extensively evaluated \nfor raspberries.

Cultural methods are \nemphasized, since regulations and restrictions concern -\ning pesticide use are continually changing and vary \nfrom state to state. Growers may or may not encounter \nthe particular diseases described herein, depending on \ngeographic region, local growing conditions, production \nsystems, and cultivar. Growers should consult their local \nextension personnel for recommendations concerning \nthe most effective management procedures available \nin their area.\nOverview\nPlant diseases have many causes. They are most often \ngrouped into two categories: biotic (those caused by \nliving things) and abiotic (those caused by non-living \nthings). Biotic plant diseases are most generally caused \nby microorganisms, the majority of which are fungi. \nOther biotic diseases are caused by bacteria, viruses, \nand nematodes. Abiotic diseases or disorders are most \nfrequently the result of adverse environmental factors. \nSymptoms of both biotic and abiotic diseases may be \nsimilar and are in some cases difficult to distinguish.\nFungi are responsible for many different plant diseases, \nincluding blights, molds, mildews, rusts, cankers, and rots. \nThey are ubiquitous in the berry plantings. Most fungi \nare beneficial because they help with decomposition of dead plant material and make nutrients available. Some compete with other harmful fungi and microorganisms \nand keep their populations low. However, a small number \nof disease-causing fungi may be extremely harmful to \nbrambles and can increase plant susceptibility to other pests. Most fungal diseases typically develop rapidly in \nwarm, wet weather, when water remains on the plant \nor in the soil after rainfall.\nBacteria also cause various forms of plant disease, including wilts, blights, spots, rots, galls, and cankers. Two \ntypes of bacterial disease occur in brambles. The most \nserious bacterial disease attacking bramble plants is crown \ngall, a bacterium that produces tumor-like growths on \nthe plant. Another relatively uncommon bacterial disease \nof brambles is fire blight, which causes cane tips to die and bend over, giving a characteristic shepherd\u2019s-crook \nappearance. Generally speaking, bacterial diseases are \nsome of the most difficult to manage. \nBrambles are susceptible to many viruses, although \nmost virus-related economic losses in the Northeast \nare attributed to three viral diseases: raspberry mosaic, \nraspberry leaf curl, and crumbly berry. In general, growers \nmust remember that all viruses are systemic, infecting the \nplant throughout its vegetative parts, with the exception \nof the meristems. Therefore, the virus is transmitted to \nany new plant derived from vegetative structures such as \nroot suckers, tip layers, etc. The most important proce -\ndure for management of any viral disease is to establish a planting from virus-tested stock. All other procedures \nare worthless if this single step is not accomplished. \nIn the field, viruses may be transmitted mechanically \n(through pruning, rubbing, or root grafts), in pollen, and \nvia insect vectors (such as aphids and leaf hoppers) and nematodes. The specific mode of transmission tends to be a defining characteristic of a particular virus.\nNematodes are microscopic soil organisms that are \nworm-like in appearance.

Although \nanthracnose often occurs on red raspberries, the severity \nof the disease is highly related to the variety. For example, \nBoyne or Killarney are very susceptible. \nThe most obvious symptom of anthracnose occurs \non the canes. Anthracnose first appears on young canes \nof black and purple raspberries as small, slightly sunken \npurple spots. As these spots enlarge, they become oval in \nshape, turn gray in the center, and develop dark, raised borders (figure 9.1). The sites continue to sink into the \nwoody portion of the cane, sometimes causing it to \ncrack. Many individual infection sites (about \u215b inch in diameter) may grow together to form large, irregularly-\nshaped diseased regions. Small, white spots may also \noccur on the foliage of infected canes.\nSeriously infected canes are weak and very prone to \nwinter injury. Cracks that begin developing during the first summer continue to deepen the following spring, further weakening the surviving canes. Foliage produced \nfrom these canes is weak, and the fruit is often small and \ntends to shrivel and dry before harvest, especially during \nperiods of water stress. The stems supporting  individual \nfruits and fruit clusters may also become infected if the \nweather is wet while they are first developing. These \ninfected stems may be girdled, resulting in significant \nyield losses. Individual drupelets of the berry may also become infected, turning brown and scabby.\nCane infections on blackberries are similar to those \ndescribed on black raspberries. However, infection of \nindividual drupelets can be a particularly serious prob -\nlem on trailing blackberries under favorable weather \nconditions. The fruits of most erect blackberries are \nrelatively resistant to infection. On red raspberry canes, individual infection sites may be smaller than on black and purple raspberries, and are sometimes only on the surface, not sunken. Many small surface infections may fuse together on primocanes during the late summer or early fall. This produces a graying of the bark, especially \non the side most exposed to the sun. Such infections \ndo not directly harm canes, but may provide spores for \nmore serious infections of susceptible bramble types \nplanted close by.\nThe anthracnose fungus overwinters within infection \nsites that developed during the preceding spring and \nsummer. Spores produced from overwintered infections are spread by splashing rain. The spores germinate and infect young canes when they emerge in the spring. The \nseverity of an infection period is proportional to both \nthe temperature and the number of hours canes remain wet after rain starts.Fig. 9.1  Sunken anthracnose lesions \non canes of black raspberry.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

The \ndisease will spread throughout a planting following rainy \nperiods, as long as succulent, susceptible tissue is avail -\nable. Disease risk is greatest between bud break and the \npreharvest period since infection appears to attack mainly \nyoung, actively growing parts of the plant.\nManagement\nThe following strategy is recommended for managing all \ncane diseases of brambles, including anthracnose:\n 1. When setting out new plants, cut off the \nhandles of tip-layered cuttings at ground level \nand destroy them. These old stubs are potential entry sites for cane disease fungi and are not needed for the production of new shoots.\n 2. Remove and destroy all fr uited canes and any \nheavily-infected primocanes after harvest. This is an important means of reducing the source of the next year\u2019s infective spores. This job must be completed before new canes begin to emerge in the spring.\n 3. Choose a planting site and use cultural practices \nthat will allow good air circulation and rapid drying of canes after a rain. Cultural practices that promote rapid drying include good weed management, maintenance of narrow rows, removal of fruited canes after harvest, and certain trellising systems, such as the V-trellis. Suppression or thinning of primocanes will also contribute to better air circulation.\n 4. Apply an eradicant fungicide, such as liquid lime \nsulfur, just as buds are breaking in the spring; follow local recommendations and restrictions. The principle is to remove a significant amount of spores being produced on the overwintered canes before they can cause new infections. Thorough coverage and timing are critical. Cane disease fungi are generally resistant to fungicides while the canes are fully dormant. However, applications after leaves begin to unfold are likely to cause plant injury. Additional sprays of a locally recommended fungicide may be neces-sary during the growing season under extreme conditions. However, the single \u201cdelayed-dormant\u201d eradicant spray usually gives adequate commercial management of cane diseases in the Northeast if used in conjunction with recom-mended horticultural practices.\n 5. Grow brambles under cover in high tunnels or a \ngreenhouse to reduce disease pressure.\nCane Blight\nScientific name: Diapleella coniothyrium (Fuckel) Barr\nCane blight is a potentially serious disease on all \ncultivated raspberries and blackberries in North America. \nThis blight usually occurs as a result of specific cultural \npractices that create wound sites for the disease to enter. \nCane blight occurs most commonly on black raspber-ries as a result of summer tipping. It also occurs on red raspberries, where it has been noted to be less common \nthan spur blight but much more destructive. Up to a \n30% loss of yield due to cane blight has been measured in heavily infested fields. Because spur blight and cane \nblight often occur together, some of the damage histori -\ncally attributed to spur blight has probably been caused by cane blight.\nInfections begin only on first-year canes at wound \nsites, such as pruning or tipping cuts, cane injuries cre -\nated by rubbing against other canes or trellis wires, or insect-feeding punctures. A dark infected area develops beneath the surface of the cane and may extend up and \ndown one side of the cane or may girdle it several inches \nFig. 9.2  \n Cane blight on thornless blackberry.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

The leaves also \nmay show dark, wedge-shaped, dead patches extending \nalong the midrib or main veins out to the leaf margin. The \nblades of such leaves often fall off, leaving the petiole (leaf \nstem) attached to the cane.\nDiscolored areas of the cane remain brown or purple \nuntil early fall, when small, black, pimple-like fruiting \nbodies of the spur blight fungus form within the bark of \ninfected regions. The bark turns gray and may develop \nshallow, lengthwise cracks. Canes that become severely \ndefoliated or cracked are more susceptible to winter injury. \nBuds within the infected region may fail to break the \nfollowing spring. If they do break, they produce weak, \nunproductive laterals. Healthy buds in the top of the \ncane, however, may compensate for this production loss when infections are only in lower cane regions, as is the case in most years.\nSpores produced in fruiting bodies on overwintered \ncanes start the disease cycle the following growing sea -\nson. These spores escape into the air during rainy peri -\nods from mid-spring through early summer. They are \ncarried by air currents to newly emerging canes where they germinate and cause infection if the canes remain \nwet long enough. A second type of spore is produced \nwithin new infection sites during the summer. This type is spread by splashing rain and can lead to an epidemic development of disease during excessively wet years.\nManagement strategies are the same as outlined for \nanthracnose above.below the wound. Often, the infection extends along \nthe cane for several nodes, in contrast to spur blight, \nwhich generally stays in the area around a single node. The wood of infected canes breaks easily and eventually becomes covered with tiny black fruiting structures of \nthe cane blight fungus. Lateral shoots emerging from \nbuds near or above infected regions are weak and may wilt and collapse. The entire cane can be killed if infec -\ntion occurs near the ground (figure 9.2).\nSpores from fruiting bodies in old, infected canes or \ndead canes are released during rainy periods, beginning \nin the spring. The spores are dispersed by wind currents \nor splashing rain, and they germinate and infect new canes if wound sites are available. New fruiting bodies are produced from these infection sites as the season \nprogresses, providing many more spores for further \ndisease spread.\nAdditional infections may occur any time during the \ngrowing season if wounds are present, and are particu -\nlarly favored by extended periods of warm, wet weather. The fungus eventually overwinters within the infected canes, then produces new fruiting bodies the following spring, completing the disease cycle. The fruiting bodies \nproduced from overwintering infections can continue to \nrelease infective spores for up to four years if the cane debris is not destroyed.\nIn addition to the strategies outlined for managing \nanthracnose, it is important to minimize cane wounding. \nIn particular, any pruning, topping, or tipping during \nthe growing season should be done during a period \nof dry weather, at least three days before any expected \nrain, to allow cuts a chance to heal before a potential \ninfection period.\nSpur Blight\nScientific name: Didymella applanata (Niessl) Sacc.\nSpur blight is a very common disease of red raspberries \nthroughout the eastern half of North America, but is rare \non other brambles. Although spur blight has traditionally \nbeen considered a serious disease of red raspberries, its economic significance has probably been exaggerated.\nSymptoms of spur blight first appear in early summer. \nChocolate-brown or purple discolorations initially develop \non new canes just below points of leaf attachment, usually \non the lower portion of the cane. The discoloration then expands up and down the cane, but usually stops before \nFig. 9.3  Spur blight on canes of red raspberry.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

F.\nCane botrytis is caused by the same fungus that causes \ngray mold of bramble fruits. Red raspberries appear to \nbe most susceptible to this disease, but it may occur on most Rubus species. \nCane botrytis is potentially more damaging than, and \noften confused with, spur blight. In fact both diseases may be present on the same cane; both occupy the same ecological niche and do similar things to plant growth. \nLike spur blight, buds at infected nodes are reduced in size \nand are less likely to produce healthy lateral shoots. \nCane botrytis infections first appear in mid- to late \nsummer as pale brown leaf spots (lesions) on mature to senescent primocane leaves (figure 9.4). Younger, more vigorous leaves are not susceptible to infection by this pathogen. Infected leaves are usually shed prematurely. The fungus spreads over time from leaf lesions through the petiole and into the cane. Pale brown cane lesions \ndevelop and spread rapidly around the cane; on rare \noccasions these lesions may girdle and kill the primocane. \nSingle leaf infections may lead to a lesion that covers \nthree or four internodes. Where two cane botrytis lesions \nmeet, a sharp boundary is always visible. This is also true \nwhere botrytis and spur blight lesions meet on canes \ninfected with both diseases.\nIn spring, young lesions of both diseases are diffi -\ncult to tell apart. As lesions mature, they become more \ndistinguishable. Spur blight lesions are a much darker \nchocolate-brown color; cane botrytis lesions often dis-\nplay conspicuous banding patterns or a water-marked \nappearance due to fluctuating rates of pathogen growth. \nHealthy green vascular tissue is revealed under botrytis \ncane lesions when infected surface tissues are scraped \naway.\nAs botrytis-infected canes turn brown in the fall, \nlesions become indistinguishable from healthy tissue. They \nmay take on a grayish-white appearance and become evi -\ndent again after several weeks of low temperatures. Shiny, \nblack, blister-like structures (sclerotia) form beneath the \nepidermis during winter. These erupt from underneath the \nbark in spring and produce gray masses of powdery spores \n(conidia) during periods of high humidity or rainfall. \nConidia are dispersed by wind and water-splash (rainfall, \noverhead irrigation) to start new infections. Sclerotia are \nprobably the principal source of inoculum in the spring, but most plant debris may be colonized by this fungus and produce conidia under wet conditions. \nAs only mature to senescent leaves are infected by \nthis pathogen, disease is most severe inside dense, closed \ncanopies, predominantly on the lower halves of pri -\nmocanes. Pruning to open canopies, and keeping crop rows narrow and plantings weed free may help reduce \nor minimize development of this disease. Other produc -\ntion practices that promote rapid drying of foliage and canes will also be beneficial. Fungicides applied before \nharvest for control of botrytis fruit infections should give \nadequate control of this disease on canes if thorough \ncoverage of all plant surfaces is achieved.\nFruit Diseases\nBotrytis Fruit Rot and Blossom Blight  \n(Gray Mold)\nScientific name: Botrytis cinerea Pers.

Dagger nematodes in the soil may have picked up the virus from infected weeds or crop plants. \nThe virus has a wide host range including dandelion, \nchickweed, fruit trees, and grapes.\nOnce plants are infected, the disease spreads from \nplant to plant at a rate of about six feet per year, produc -\ning the circular or oblong patches associated with the \ndisease. New pockets of infection may be formed if soil infested with virus-carrying nematodes is distributed to \nuninfested parts of the field during various management \nactivities such as cultivation, harvesting, spraying, etc.\nNematodes thrive in the same light, well-drained \nsoils that are best for bramble production. Soils should \nbe tested for the presence of Xiphinema  nematodes dur -\ning the year before planting and treated with a preplant \nfumigant if test results are positive. Growers should \ncheck with their local Cooperative Extension offices for suggestions on sampling procedures and dates.\nIt may be practical to reduce spread by removing \nand destroying infected plants if there are only a few. \nIn such cases, at least five plants beyond those showing symptoms should be removed in each row, including all weeds and suckers in the row. As many roots as possible \nshould be removed, particularly the large ones which \nwill be slow to decompose. The infected area should be kept absolutely free of vegetation for two years before replanting is attempted.\nRaspberry Bushy Dwarf\nScientific name: Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV)\nRaspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) can cause \nserious losses in susceptible cultivars of red and black \nraspberries and blackberries, though it is less common in blackberries. RBDV occurs wherever raspberries are \ngrown. The primary symptom of RBDV is crumbly \nfruit due to poor drupelet set (figure 9.7). Leaf chlo -\nrosis from very mild to bright yellow also develops on some cultivars of red raspberry and blackberry, but this has not been observed on black or purple raspberries \n(figure 9.8). Plants infected with RBDV alone are rarely \nstunted. When RBDV occurs in mixed infections with \nother viruses, crumbly fruit symptoms generally are more \nsevere and stunting may occur.\nIn many cultivars, infected plants are only recognized \nby the crumbly fruit symptom, though bright yellow \nchlorosis is very obvious in some cultivars. The name \n\u201cBushy Dwarf \u201d is a misnomer since the virus rarely \ncauses a bushy dwarf symptom in single infections. \nThe disease name comes from plants that were dou -\nbly infected with RBDV and Black raspberry necrosis \nvirus, but at the time only RBDV was isolated from \nthe symptomatic plants.\nRBDV is spread from plant to plant by pollen and, \ntherefore, is difficult to control once the virus is  presen t in \nFig. 9.7  Crumbly berry of red raspberry \ncaused by raspberry bushy dwarf virus.\nFig. 9.8  Raspberry bushy dwarf virus: \ninfected Marion foliage and fruit.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

The rate of spread is cultivar dependent. There are \nsources of resistance to RBDV, but in many cases resistant \ncultivars have inferior horticultural traits. Breeding for \nRBDV resistance is a high priority for most raspberry breeding programs around the world. The best strategy for growers is to use planting stock that has tested free \nof RBDV. Bees readily travel up to one-half mile, so \nisolation from infected plantings is also important. In \nlarger plantings, blocks of susceptible cultivars should \nbe isolated from one another with resistant cultivars \nplanted between to serve as barriers for bee movement of pollen between susceptible cultivars. Wild brambles are often not a major concern for RBDV since pollina -\ntion is inefficient across species, though planting black \nraspberries near wild black raspberries may be a problem \nsince the native species, Rubus occidentalis, is also used \ncommercially.\nBlackberry Sterility\nCause unknown\nBlackberry sterility is not fully understood, but is prob -\nably a symptom of a viral disease or a genetic disorder. \nSterility occurs in all growing areas of the U.S. Although \ninfected blackberries may grow more vigorously than \nhealthy blackberries, they may either fail to set fruit at all, or if they do, the berries may be deformed.\nTo manage sterility, any blackberries that do not set \nfruit should be removed and burned. The roots should also be dug up to prevent new sterile shoots from grow-\ning. Only certified disease-free blackberries should be \nincluded in a new planting. The cultivar Darrow is known \nto be susceptible to this disorder.Sunscald (Sunburn)\nCause: Solar injury\nWhile the exact nature of sunscald is not fully under -\nstood, it appears that berries exposed to direct, intense sunlight are especially prone to develop this condition. \nAffected drupelets have a bleached, whitened appearance \nat first, but eventually dry and collapse and are visually \nunattractive (figure 9.9). Sections of the fruit become \nbrown and dry. Berries shaded by the canopy may also develop sunscald in the absence of direct sunlight when exposed to high temperatures. \nThis disorder is more common in blackberries than \nraspberries. There is some variation in susceptibility \nbetween types of blackberries; trailing types are less \nsusceptible than erect or semi-erect blackberries. Varia -\ntions in cultivar susceptibility also appear to exist within \nthe same species.\nWhite Drupelet Disorder\nCause: Solar injury\nThis disorder most commonly occurs on red raspberry \nand results from a combination of exposure to ultravio -\nlet radiation and high temperature. Drupelets develop \nnormally but remain white (figure 9.10). These white \ndrupelets may occur singly or in groups. Since berries \nwith white drupelet disorder vary from normal fruit \nonly in the absence of pigment, they remain suitable for \nprocessing, but are usually unacceptable for fresh market \nsales. Research by Renquist and Hughes (1987, 1989) \nsuggests that shading plants to reduce UV radiation \nmay lessen the problem. Some differences in cultivar \nsusceptibility to this disorder have also been noted.Fig. 9.10  White drupelet disorder \nof Heritage red raspberry.\nFig. 9.9  Sunscald on Royalty fruit. \nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

Hiratsuka and Gymnoconia nitens (Schwein.) F. Kern & H.W. Thurston\nOrange rust is a serious fungus disease attacking all \ncultivars of black and purple raspberries, erect blackber-\nries, and most trailing blackberries. It does not attack \nred raspberries. \nThe disease is most easily identified in the spring. \nYoung shoots that first develop are weak and spindly, \nwith small, pale green or yellowish leaves (figure 9.11). Within two to three weeks, blisters form on the lower \nsurface of the leaves and then rupture, producing masses \nof powdery, rust-colored fungus spores (figure 9.12). These \nleaves wither and drop off in late spring, and new leaves produced toward the tips of canes may appear normal, giving the impression that the plant has \u201cgrown out\u201d of \nthe disease. However, such canes will remain infected \nthe following spring, producing a mass of spindly shoots \nwith no blossoms.\nThe orange rust fungi overwinter within infected \nplants, which they colonize systemically (throughout the \nplant). Thus, new shoots arising from the roots or crowns \nof plants infected the previous year are already infected. \nThe rust-colored spores produced upon the leaves of \nthese shoots early in the growing season are spread by \nwind currents. The spores can infect the leaves of healthy \nplants under the proper environmental conditions. These \nconditions are not well defined, but are presumed to be relatively stringent.\nOn black raspberries, new leaf infections are confined \nto a small area, but they eventually produce a mass of \nbrown or black spores in late summer or early fall. This \nsecond spore type then infects buds on cane tips that \nare just rooting, or new buds and shoots being formed on the crowns of mature plants. The fungus grows down into the crown and root system. On blackberries, direct \ninfection of healthy young shoots occurs by the rust-\ncolored spores that are liberated in the spring, and then \nthe fungus spreads into the below-ground portions of \nthe new plant. In either case, infected shoots that arise during the following year produce a new crop of spores and the cycle continues. Disease spread may also occur \nthrough natural root grafting of adjacent infected and \nhealthy plants.\nManagement of orange rust depends entirely on elimi -\nnating sources of new infections. New plantings should always be started from nursery stock known to be free of \nthis disease. Any plants showing rust symptoms during the \nspring in which they are set out were already infected at \nthe time of planting; they should be immediately destroyed \nbefore the fungal spores can be discharged.\nEstablished plantings should be examined for orange \nrust every year during the first weeks of the growing sea -\nson, when symptoms are easiest to observe. Any infected \nplants are economically worthless and should be dug up and destroyed promptly before they liberate a new crop of spores. The location of such plants should be clearly \nmarked, and any new suckers that arise from root pieces \nleft in the ground should be removed or sprayed with \nan approved systemic herbicide. Nearby wooded areas or \nfence rows should be searched for signs of wild brambles \ninfected with orange rust, which should be destroyed.\nLate Leaf Rust\nScientific name: Pucciniastrum americanum (Farl.)

The removal or eradication of white spruce \nin the vicinity of plantings is not recommended since the \ndisease can occur in its absence. Fungicide options are \nlimited. Although fungicides may be helpful for managing \ndisease on primocane-fruiting cultivars, they are almost \nnever needed on floricane-fruiting cultivars.\nLeaf Spot\nScientific name:  Sphaerulina rubi Demaree & M.S. Wilcox \nLeaf spot of raspberries affects susceptible culti -\nvars of red, purple, and black raspberries. Blackberries \nappear immune to the raspberry leaf spot fungus, but \nare susceptible to a cane and leaf spot disease caused by a different fungus, Septoria rubi Westend., that does not \ninfect raspberries.\nBoth diseases are most severe in seasons with fre -\nquent warm rains, such as those typically encountered in \nsouthern growing regions. However, highly susceptible \ncultivars such as Taylor may be heavily infected. The \nplants are prematurely defoliated and have increased \nsusceptibility to winter injury. The following discussion will concentrate on the raspberry leaf spot disease.than orange rust of black raspberries and blackberries, and the two should not be confused.\nBecause late leaf rust does not develop until late \nsummer, it has traditionally been considered a disease of \nonly minor importance on conventional floricane -fruiti ng \ncultivars. In some years, however, late leaf rust can cause \nsignificant economic damage on primocane-fruiting \ncultivars, which are in fruit during the period of disease \ndevelopment. Also, in New England, some floricane-\n fruiting cultivars contract late leaf rust as early as the \ngreen fruit stage, resulting in nearly 100% loss of market -\nable fruit. Festival, Nova, and Heritage cultivars appear to be extremely susceptible to late leaf rust.\nSmall, yellow spots develop on the upper surface of \nmature leaves in late summer or early fall (figure 9.13). \nSmall blisters filled with powdery, rust-colored spores form \non the undersides of these same leaves (figure 9.14). Heav -\nily infected leaves may turn yellow and fall prematurely. \nFruit infections may also occur during this period, develop -\ning as a mass of rust-colored spores on one to several of the \nindividual drupelets of the aggregate berry (figure 9.15).\nThe disease cycle of late leaf rust is poorly under -\nstood. In most cases, the fungus appears to overwinter on the canes of infected raspberry plants, although it is not systemic like orange rust. Spores produced from the overwintering sites start a new round of leaf infections in the summer. The rust-colored spores produced from \nthese infections then spread the disease to additional \nleaves and fruit.\nPeriods of free moisture are presumed necessary for \ninfection to occur, but the specific effects of temperature \nand wetness duration have not been determined. In some \nlocations, the fungus overwinters on white spruce trees, \nan alternate host, from which it infects raspberries the \nfollowing year. However, the general presence of late leaf \nrust in areas free of white spruce suggests that the alternate \nhost is not required for completion of the disease cycle.\nManagement measures are somewhat limited. Cultural \npractices that promote air circulation through the plant-\ning (such as thinning canes, narrowing rows, and weed \nmanagement) help to quickly dry susceptible foliage and \nreduce the number of infections. Plantings should not be \nestablished in the vicinity of white spruce.

Individual leaflets may show anywhere from 1 to \nover 100 distinct spots, depending on the cultivar and severity of disease pressure. With time, infected tissue within these spots may fall out, producing a \u201cshot hole\u201d effect. Badly infected leaves may curl at the edges, dry up, and drop prematurely. Inconspicuous spots may also develop on the canes, particularly near their bases.\nThe fungus overwinters in inconspicuous cane lesions \nor infected fallen leaves. Spores produced from these \nsites are distributed the following spring by air currents \nand splashing rain, infecting young canes and leaves \nwhile they remain wet. Additional spores are produced from these new infection sites and are distributed by splashing rains throughout the summer, spreading the disease. Only young, growing tissues are susceptible to infection.\nManagement practices designed to promote good \nair circulation and rapid drying of foliage will limit \ndisease severity. Where practical, fruiting canes should be removed immediately after harvest, and fallen leaves \nraked or cultivated before bud break to reduce fungal \ninoculum. Broad spectrum fungicides applied for man -\naging other diseases also may provide control of leaf \nspot, but most materials specific for gray mold do not. Growers must check local extension recommendations and restrictions. Taylor is highly susceptible; Killarney, Canby, and Brandywine have also shown above-average levels of disease under New York conditions.\nPowdery Mildew\nScientific name: Sphaerotheca macularis  (Wallr.:Fr.)Lind.\nPowdery mildew occurs on raspberries throughout \nNorth America especially when grown under tunnels or \nin greenhouses. However, only a few popular cultivars are highly susceptible to the disease, and the severity of disease can vary greatly from year to year. \nInfected leaves may become covered with the white, \npowdery growth of the fungus, or may simply develop \nlight green blotches on their surfaces (figure 9.17). Blotch -\ning that occurs early in the growing season is easily \nconfused with the symptoms of mosaic virus. Infected shoot tips may become long and spindly with dwarfed leaves. Heavily infected plants may be stunted.The fungus overwinters within infected buds near \nthe tips of heavily infected canes. Shoots that emerge \nfrom these buds the following spring are infected, and spores produced upon them are distributed by air cur -\nrents to spread the disease. Repeated cycles of infection \ncan continue throughout the summer. Unlike most fun -\ngal diseases, powdery mildew infections do not require periods of wetness in which to develop.

It is an extremely serious disease of black \nraspberries in the Northeast and is probably the most \nimportant factor limiting production where the disease occurs. Red raspberries are affected much less seriously, \nwhile purple raspberries are affected intermediately. \nBlackberries generally are not affected.\nSymptoms are most prominent early in the season. On \nblack raspberries, leaves show a mosaic pattern of light \ngreen blotches among the normal dark green background, \nand may develop large dark green blisters surrounded \nby yellowish tissue (figure 9.18). Such leaves are usually \nsmaller than normal and may be deformed, although \nleaves produced during warmer summer weather are \ngenerally symptomless. Young shoot tips often turn black \nand die. Infected canes become progressively more stunted \neach year until they finally die (figure 9.19). The fruit \non infected plants is small, seedy, and tasteless. Infected \nred raspberries may show varying reductions in vigor, \nand mild or inconspicuous leaf symptoms, depending \non the cultivar.\nSpread is almost entirely caused by a single insect, \nthe large raspberry aphid, Amphorophora agathonica. The \naphid picks up the virus as it feeds on infected raspber -\nries, wild or cultivated, and then transmits it to healthy \nplants as it feeds on them. Spread can be very rapid, with disease incidence increasing from \na small percentage to a majority of the planting in a period of just two \nto three years. The activity of the \naphid occurs primarily from mid-\nJune through mid-August.\nIn regions where mosaic is com -\nmon, management strategies are \ndesigned to delay rather than pre -\nvent the development of this disease, \nparticularly on black  raspbe rries. \nHowever, procedures that success -\nfully delay the start of a mosaic epi-\ndemic by even one or two seasons \ncan have a tremendous impact on \nthe profitability of a planting.\nFirst, a new planting of black raspberries should not \nbe placed next to an old planting of black, purple, or \nred raspberries or blackberries. The old plants may be \ncarriers of the disease, even if they appear symptom -\nless. There is no absolute \u201csafe\u201d distance, but 150 to 200 yards between plantings should be a minimum, if at all practical. Similarly, a new planting of black raspberries \nmust not be placed next to a wooded area containing \nwild brambles. All wild brambles in nearby fence rows or ditch banks should be destroyed.\nSome newer purple and red raspberry cultivars such \nas Royalty and Titan are immune or highly resistant \nto colonization by the large raspberry aphid and are \nmuch slower to get the disease. Management of the \naphid vector (carrier of disease) with insecticides may \nslow disease spread within a field, but is very unlikely to prevent its introduction.\nRaspberry Leaf Curl\nCause: Uncharacterized virus\nRaspberry leaf curl can cause serious yield losses where \nit occurs, but it is not as common as raspberry mosaic. \nLeaf curl is found throughout most of the Northeast, but \nreportedly is rare along the eastern seaboard south of New \nY ork. Both red and black raspberries are seriously affected, \npurple raspberries somewhat less so. Some blackberry \ncultivars show symptoms similar to those on red and \nblack raspberries, but others remain symptomless.\nInfected plants can be recognized in the field by their \ncharacteristic foliage\u2014uniformly small leaves which curl \nFig. 9.18   Leaf symptoms of \nraspberry mosaic disease \non black raspberry.Fig. 9.19   Stunting of black \nraspberry plant  caused by \nraspberry mosaic disease.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

In New York, populations \nof this insect appear to reach a minor peak in late July and a major peak in early October. The small raspberry \naphids are relatively inactive, and may spend their entire \nlives on a single leaf, although they are sometimes car -\nried long distances on wind currents. Spread of leaf \ncurl, therefore, is much slower than that of mosaic due \nto the different feeding habits of the respective aphid \nvectors. This fact, and the tendency of the small raspberry \naphid to remain on affected foliage, makes a program \nof periodic inspection and removal of infected plants \na practical means of limiting losses in fields where the disease does occur.\nCultural management strategies include the use of \nclean planting stock, not planting new fields near infected \nwild or cultivated raspberries, and quick removal and \ndestruction of infected plants after they have been identi -\nfied in a field. Insecticides may be used to limit populations \nof the aphid vector.\nRoot Diseases\nPhytophthora Root Rot\nScientific name: Phytophthora spp., P . fragariae var. rubi, \nP . megasperma, P . cactorum, and others\nPhytophthora root rot is caused by several related \nspecies of soil-borne fungi belonging to the genus Phy-\ntophthora. The disease can be very destructive on red and purple raspberries when conditions \nfavor its development, but black rasp -\nberries and blackberries appear to be \nmuch less susceptible.\nAlthough it appears commonly \nin the Midwest and Northeast, the disease has only lately been recog -\nnized as a serious problem. Phytoph -\nthora root rot has been identified as \nthe cause of the decline of stands of \nred and purple raspberries previously \nthought to be suffering from winter injury or \u201cwet feet.\u201d\nThe root rot is most commonly associated with heavy \nsoils or portions of a planting where water accumulates, such as lower ends of rows, dips in the field, etc. Infec -\ntions often occur in patches in the planting, which often \nexpand over time.\nInfected fruiting canes are often stunted with weak \nlateral shoots and leaves that yellow prematurely or \nscorch along the margins and between the veins (figure \n9.21). Severely infected fruiting canes wilt and die as the \nweather turns warm before harvest (figure 9.22). Fewer \nnew canes will emerge from within diseased patches, \nin contrast with normal numbers of canes that emerge when fruiting cane collapse is caused by winter injury, \nanthracnose, or cane blight. New canes may become \ninfected, wilt, and die during their first year.\nBecause wilting and collapsing plants may be caused \nby other factors, the root systems of affected plants must \nbe examined to diagnose Phytophthora root rot. Plants that are wilting but have not yet died should be dug up \nand the outer surface (epidermis) scraped from the main \nroots and crown. Tissue just beneath the epidermis should \nbe white on healthy plants, but will be a characteristic red-brown on plants with Phytophthora root rot (figure \n9.23). It will eventually turn dark brown as the tissue \ndecays. A distinct line can often be seen where infected and healthy tissues meet, especially on the crown.\nThe fungi primarily persist in infected roots or as \ndormant resting spores in the soil.

Each new infection \nsite can serve as a source of additional infective spores, \nproviding the potential for epidemic disease development \nin sites that are frequently wet or following a succession \nof several excessively wet seasons.\nThe keys to managing Phytophthora  root rot are good \nsoil drainage and proper cultivar selection. All brambles \nshould be planted on well-drained soil, especially red \nraspberry cultivars that are highly susceptible to Phy -\ntophthora root rot, particularly Titan and Ruby. Canby, Taylor, Reveille, and Festival cultivars also appear to be \nvery susceptible.

Black raspberries and blackberries appear \nto be relatively resistant to this disease, although they \nare not completely immune if grown in very wet soils. Growing plants on raised beds is one possible cultural \nmethod for minimizing root rot where drainage is occa -sionally inadequate. However, supplemental irrigation \nmust be available to get plants through drought periods. \nAmending soil with gypsum has also been shown to \nsuppress Phytophthora.\nThe Phytophthora  fungi are often introduced onto \na farm by the movement of contaminated soil from \nrunoff water, farm equipment, or symptomless nursery \nstock.

Tissue-cultured \nplants that were matured in a nursery field before digging \nare no less likely to be contaminated with Phytophthora \nthan are conventionally propagated plants.

Susceptibility among blackberry cultivars and \ntypes is variable. \nDuring the first year of infection, leaves on the new \ncanes of black and purple raspberry plants become pale green in mid-summer. These leaves may eventually turn yellow and drop prematurely, or the plant may appear to \nrecover during cool fall weather. However, some buds will \nnot break on infected fruiting canes the following spring. \nLeaves that do develop turn yellow, wilt, and die, start -\ning at the bottom of the plant and moving progressively \ntoward the top. Canes may eventually become completely \ndefoliated, except for a few leaves at the top (figure 9.24).\nInfected canes are usually stunted, and may develop \nstreaks of blue in the bark before they finally wilt and die. Symptoms sometimes appear first on only one side of the plant, while the opposite side remains healthy for \nsome time before also becoming infected. Symptoms on \ninfected red raspberry canes are similar but less severe, \nand suckers arising away from the infected mother plant \nare often free of the disease, although their numbers \nmay be reduced.\nThe fungus persists in the soil in an actively growing \nstate or as dormant resting structures. Infection occurs when roots come in contact with the active fungus or a germinating resting structure. The disease is favored by \ncool, wet, spring weather. The fungus can infect through \nboth healthy or wounded roots and root hairs. After \ninitial penetration, the fungus grows into the water-\nconducting cells of the root (xylem). There, it produces \nspores that help spread the infection upward into the \ncane xylem with the normal flow of water. Infected \nxylem cells develop constrictions and become plugged \nby the growth of the fungus within them. Eventually, the flow of water is so restricted that the canes wilt and \ndie. Fungal structures are then returned to the soil as \nthe dead roots decompose and spores become available to infect new plants.\nDisease severity depends on the population of Verticil -\nlium in the soil at the time of planting, which is largely \ndetermined by the previous cropping history of the field. \nFields with a recent history of highly susceptible crops are \nlikely to contain dangerous levels of the fungus. Potatoes, \ntomatoes, eggplants, and peppers are particularly suscep -\ntible to Verticillium wilt. Squash, melons, strawberries, \nand stone fruit trees are less susceptible crops. Also, sites \nwhich have supported high levels of susceptible weed \nplants such as pigweed, nightshade, horse nettle, ground \ncherry, and lamb\u2019s quarters are also likely to contain \nhigh levels of the Verticillium wilt fungus. Such fields should be planted to a non-host crop for at least three \nto four years before raspberries, especially blacks and \npurple types, are planted. The fields can be fumigated \nwith an approved material active against fungi.

Crown gall may stunt and weaken seri -\nously infected plants, but probably causes little economic \ndamage in most fields where it occurs.\nGalls produced on infected plants are rough, spongy-\nto-hard, tumorous growths up to an inch or more in \ndiameter. On red raspberries, galls are found most often \non the roots (figure 9.25). On black and purple raspber -\nries, they are more common on the crown near the soil line. Galls are sometime produced on lower canes.\nThe crown gall bacteria persist in and on infected plant \ntissue in the soil. They are distributed throughout a field by any means that distributes soil. The bacterium enters a plant through wounds on the roots or crown caused by \ngrowth cracks, insect feeding, winter injury, or cultivation.\nOnce inside the plant, the bacteria cause nearby cells \nto begin multiplying and enlarging abnormally, creating the tumorous galls. As galls enlarge, they may disrupt the normal vascular system and interfere with the flow \nof water and nutrients. The amount of harm to the plant \ndepends on the size, number, and placement of individual \ngalls. The outer gall layers are filled with bacteria and \nprovide inoculum for further disease spread as they are continuously shed into the surrounding soil.\nManagement procedures include: (1) planting only \nnursery stock that is free of any obvious galls on crowns \nor roots; (2) not planting into a field where crown gall has \noccurred previously, unless a non-host crop, such as straw -\nberries or most vegetables, is grown for two or more years \nbefore replanting; and (3) minimizing injury to root and \ncrown systems during farm operations such as cultivation.\nWinter Injury\nCause: Cold temperatures\nWinter injury is a common ailment of Rubus spp. in \nthe north. Winter injury can manifest itself in a variety \nof ways. A late frost in the spring can result in the death \nof flower buds on floricane-fruiting varieties and lead \nto a total crop loss (figure 9.26). Similarly, early autumn \nfrosts often terminate fruiting on primocane-fruiting \ncultivars. Very cold temperatures during winter can kill overwintering floricanes and may even damage the root system. The most common form of winter injury, how -\never, results from fluctuating temperatures during the \ndormant season. This injury occurs after plants have \nachieved their chilling requirements, and plants are no \nlonger fully dormant. Warm spells (i.e., fluctuating warm and cold periods) during the winter tend to damage the less cold-tolerant tissues. Often injury occurs in March when temperatures fluctuate more, rather than in mid-winter, when plants are completely dormant.\nWinter injury usually kills or damages the overwin -\ntering floricanes but not new primocanes. In contrast, \nplants affected by Phytophthora or Verticillium  do not \nproduce a healthy flush of primocanes. Occasionally, \nwinter injury is not apparent until fruiting laterals begin \nto grow. This is because only part of the vascular tissue is damaged. With the onset of warm temperatures, the injured vascular connections cannot supply the laterals with water, so the laterals collapse. This can be mistaken \nfor Verticillium wilt. However, winter injury rarely affects \nthe roots whereas Verticillium- infected plants may produce \ndistinct root symptoms.\nThe only reasonable means to preventing winter injury \nare avoiding frost pockets, establishing plantings in areas \nwith good air drainage to minimize exposure to damaging \nspring frosts, and planting cultivars that are sufficiently winter hardy.\nFig. 9.26  Winter injury to floricanes.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

These \nlesions merge to form large, brown areas. Initially, a \nproliferation of new young roots forms in response to root injury, giving the feeder roots a brushy, or witch\u2019s \nbroom appearance (figure 9.27).

Weed \nmanagement is particularly important in the planting \nyear, for if the berry plants establish well, then weeds are \neasier to exclude and manage in subsequent years.\nEliminate Weeds Prior to Planting\nA combination of approaches is required to manage \nweeds effectively. Eliminating perennial weeds prior to planting is the most critical step. Planting cover crops, \ndeep plowing, discing, spraying herbicides like glyphosate \n(e.g., Roundup), or covering the site with black plastic \nfor several months can all help manage weeds prior \nto planting brambles. Once bramble plants are in the \nground, though, these effective tactics cannot be used. There is no combination of herbicides that will remove all established perennial weeds in the row without sig -\nnificantly damaging the bramble plants. \nA broad-spectrum, postemergent, systemic herbicide \ncan reduce the number of perennial weeds in a field, \nespecially if it is applied the year before planting. Grow -\ners generally find that two applications work best\u2014one applied in late spring, then another applied in late sum-\nmer of the year prior to planting. Applying the herbicide \ntoo early in spring could result in missing late-emerging \nperennial weeds, such as bindweed and nutsedge.\nPreplant cover crops can be grown to compete with \nemerging weeds, provided they do not produce seeds \nthemselves (see \u201cSite Selection and Preparation,\u201d chap -\nter two). Many cover crops are available that can be \ngrown the year prior to berries to suppress weeds and \nto add organic matter to the soil. These can be effec -\ntive at suppressing annual weeds after application of a broad-spectrum, postemergent herbicide like glyphosate \n(e.g., Roundup). Specific hybrids of sudan grass and \nmarigolds have a suppressive effect on nematodes, and many cover crop rotations can reduce disease inoculum. \nCover crops that are unrelated to berries (such as grasses \nand grains) usually make good rotational companions. Alternatively, food or fiber crops (other than brambles) \ncan be grown to enable growers to use herbicides labeled \nfor the primary weed species present in the field. This allows the grower to manage problem weeds on a site prior to planting brambles. In these situations, however, \nthere is the possibility of herbicide carryover, depending \non the herbicide used and the raspberry plant\u2019s sensitivity \nto it. Sweet corn, in particular, is a good rotational crop with berries, especially if the stover is worked into the \nsoil to retain organic matter. For example, early sweet \ncorn can be followed with oats to provide significant \nweed suppression in a single year. Fumigation also can \nreduce the weed seed bank prior to planting, but this \noption is expensive and is becoming limited due to grow -\ning environmental concerns and availability (see Site \n Selection and Site Preparation, chapter two).\nWeed Management around the Planting\nGrowers may spend considerable time managing weeds in the berry field, but do little to manage weeds around \nthe perimeter. These perimeter weeds can serve as a \nsignificant source of weed seeds. Mow the perimeters of \nthe berry fields as one would a lawn to keep weeds from flowering and going to seed.

Herbicides alone will not rescue a weedy \nberry field.\nMulching raspberries the first year with straw or \nplanting them through plastic are effective ways of sup -\npressing weeds in the row (figure 10.1). However, mulches \nare only good for the first few months because canes \nhave to eventually grow to replace those that will fruit and die. Do not mulch around bramble plants after the establishment year, especially if soils are heavy, as it may encourage root rot.\nHerbicides are available that suppress weed seed ger -\nmination. These are best applied in the late fall or early spring\u2014not during the growing season. Attempting to \nkill weeds in the raspberry row with herbicides during \nthe growing season is risky. Raspberries and  blackberries are sensitive to most postemergent her -\nbicides for broadleaf weeds (particularly \nglyphosate), and are sensitive to pre -\nemergent herbicides early in the plant -\ning year (figures 10.2, 10.4, and 10.5).\nWhen weeds do appear in the row \nduring the growing season, growers \nmust hand-weed to remove them. Cul -\ntivation is useful to a limited extent, \nbut raspberries and blackberries have \nshallow roots. Damaging them can \naffect future cane production. Further -\nmore, cultivation that damages roots \ncan increase the susceptibility of berry \nplants to disease.\nWeed Management between Rows\nGrowers either use clean cultivation between rows or plant \ngrass and mow the alleyways to manage between-row \nweeds. Cultivation has limitations because it promotes \nfurther weed seed germination, degrades soil quality, \nand can disturb the shallow root system. Further, it \nis limited by weather and the location of the weeds \nin the beds. However, cultivation is a relatively simple \nprocedure that can improve soil aeration. Cultivation \ncan dilute any herbicide that was applied previously and \ncan bring new weed seeds to the soil surface where they can germinate. Cultivation should be performed before applying an herbicide, unless the herbicide is meant to be preplant incorporated.\nShallow cultivation is preferred over deep  cultiv ation \nin established plantings.

Cultivation before harvest can \nresult in dirty fruit, so it is usually done prior to fruit set \nand at the end of the season in fruiting fields.\nBy seeding grass in the alleyways, growers can man -\nage the vegetation with mowing (figure 10.3). Perennial \nryegrass, a non-creeping fescue, or a combination of these, \nmakes an attractive ground cover. Advantages of a grass alleyway include: increasing organic matter; helping to \nstabilize erodable soils; and using excess water, which \nreduces mud and soil compaction from machinery and allows field operations to continue shortly after a rain. A seeded cover crop also can displace weeds that would \notherwise occupy the niche. Competitively displacing \nweeds with a more desirable species is better than allowing \nweeds to dominate, or destroying soil structure through \nrepeated mechanized cultivation. The primary drawback of cover crops is that they can compete with bramble \nplants for nitrogen and moisture. Managing cover crops by mowing or chemical suppression can minimize this competition.\nCompanion grass mixes (a mixture of two or more \ncompatible species) will harm brambles if allowed to \ncrowd the rows. Experiments have shown that no \namount of irrigation or nitrogen fertilizer will fully \ncompensate for the impact of unmanaged weeds or \nsod grasses on perennial crops. Therefore, a weed-free \nstrip approximately 3\u20135 feet wide should be maintained \nfor the bramble row using shallow cultivation and/or preemergent herbicides.\nHerbicide Specifics\nWeeds are the major pest of berry growers, so most \nproducers use all the tools at their disposal, including \nherbicides. Herbicides need to be applied correctly to \nmaximize performance.

Herbicides on the soil surface or in a zone \nbelow the weed seeds will not be effective. In most \nsoils, about \u00bd to 1 inch of water is required to move \nthe herbicide into the soil. In sandy soils, the water \nrequirement is less. For some herbicides on sandy soils, 1 inch of water may be excessive because the herbicide is very soluble in water and does not bind readily to the sand particles. Herbicides that have a low solubility and bind to the soil particles are desirable, except where the potential for surface runoff exists. \nPreemergent herbicides should be applied just prior \nto the seed germination period of most problem weeds. Unfortunately, weed seeds germinate over an extended period of time, but it is not practical to have high levels \nof herbicide residue present in the soil at all times. Some weeds germinate during warm weather (such as foxtails), \nand others germinate in fall (such as chickweed); but \nthe primary period of weed seed germination is in the spring. Most growers apply an herbicide in late fall or early spring to suppress spring weeds. Some herbicides applied in the fall will move into the seed germination zone during winter and be available to inhibit seedling \nestablishment in the spring. Some very soluble herbicides \napplied in the fall may wash out of the seed germination \nzone during winter and consequently should be applied in \nthe spring.

Third, prevent weed \nseeds from becoming established by using cultivation, \nestablishment-year mulching, and herbicides at the appro -\npriate times.

Herbicides that are effec -\ntive against these grasses are also toxic to brambles and should not be used. Use non-creeping, fine-leaf fescues in alleys between the rows because these will not spread readily into crop rows and will minimize the need for herbicide sprays.\nSome systemic herbicides are labeled for use for \nspot control of emerged weeds in established plant -\nings.

This chapter is \ndesigned to familiarize the grower with various aspects \nof spray technology as it relates to the application of \nspray products to bramble crops.\nAn increasing awareness of environmental pollution, \nalong with concerns about operator contamination, has \nresulted in increased pesticide-use legislation. This in \nturn has exerted considerable pressure on the food and \nfarming sectors to not only improve existing technolo -\ngies, but to also develop many new and sometimes novel \npesticide application techniques. Many of these new \ndevelopments in spray technology have the potential \nto reduce both the direct and indirect costs involved in applying pesticides. The main expense associated with \nspray applications is product cost. Product cost in many \ncases continues to rise as the pool of available products \nshrinks due to resistance development and the fewer \nnumbers of new products being developed. Other major \ncosts to consider are those of labor, energy, equipment \nmaintenance and/or replacement, and timeliness of \napplication.A full understanding of the principles of spray-\napplication technology, coupled with informed decisions \non product selection, equipment selection, calibration, \noperation, and maintenance will assist the grower to \nproduce high-quality bramble fruit while minimizing \ncrop protection costs, risks to operators, and impact on the environment.\nPrinciples of Spray Application\nProduct Selection\nAs with many other undertakings, the best success occurs \nwhen the right tools are used for the job. Correct iden -\ntification of the insect, disease, or weed problem to be \nmanaged is critical to minimizing its impact on bramble \nproduction. Have good diagnostic resources and/or refer -\nences at your disposal on the farm or online to help in making your initial diagnosis. Consult the local coop -\nerative extension office or regional specialist if the pest \nor problem cannot be identified with the resources at \nhand. Alternatively, send a sample to a diagnostic lab \nfor further testing or confirmation.\nOnce a correct diagnosis of the problem has been \nmade, the product or products to be \nused in its management may be selected. \nConsider the potential alternatives in \nregard to formulation, re-entry interval, \ndrying time, product durability, tank \nmix compatibilities, available application \nequipment, and product cost per acre. \nCarefully follow all label instructions \nwhen applying products and determin -\ning appropriate rates.

Poor spray cov -\nerage is a major factor contributing to poor pest control. \nUneven coverage increases the amount of product that \nmust be applied in order to provide adequate control \nand may increase the number of sprays required to keep the pest from becoming established. Plant canopy (leaf \nsurface) size and shape will affect the application volume \nnecessary to provide good coverage. The old adage \u201cyou \nshould spray until the leaves drip\u201d is misguided; this \nusually requires far more material than necessary for \neffective control. Likewise, lowering spray rates below \nlabel recommendations can lead to inadequate cover -\nage and, consequently, poor control. Always use the \noptimum volume to provide thorough coverage and \ncontrol, based on plant size and density, and the spray equipment used.\nDrift Management\nDrift of pesticide spray is an important and costly problem \nfacing pesticide applicators. Drifting pesticide can result \nin damage to susceptible off-target crops, environmental \ncontamination, and a lower-than-intended rate to the \ntarget crop, thus reducing the effectiveness of the pesti -\ncide. Pesticide drift also affects neighboring properties, often leading to concern and debate. \nThere are two types of drift: airborne drift, which is \noften very noticeable, and vapor drift. The amount of vapor \ndrift will depend upon atmospheric conditions such as \nhumidity, temperature, and the product being applied.

Replace damaged items promptly, especially gloves.\nSprayer Basics\nThe basic purpose of the sprayer is to deliver nutrients \nand crop protectants from the sprayer to the desired \ntarget such as soil, crop, or non-crop plants. The basic components of a sprayer consist of a tank to carry the spray mix, and a pump to provide agitation and deliver \nthe spray through a pressure regulator to the nozzles. \nThe spray is carried from the nozzle to the target via \nhydraulic pressure or air assistance.\nBramble sprayers are usually air-assisted machines, \neither traditional airblast sprayers or modern directed-deposition sprayers, such as vertical booms. Growers of small areas may be able to use a back-pack sprayer or a hand-held system.\nSprayer Tanks\nSprayer tanks vary in size from a few gallons on a  backpa ck \nsprayer to 500 gallons on a large, trailed machine. Modern \ntanks are made from corrosion-resistant materials such as plastic, fiberglass, or stainless steel. Stainless steel is \nthe strongest but also the heaviest. A large hatch, fitted with a lid and a strainer, provides access for filling and \ncleaning. The use of tank rinsing aids (small spinning \ndiscs or nozzle heads) fitted in the top of the tank are \nrecommended. They reduce the amount of washing water \n(rinsate) and time required to wash out sprayer tanks and \nreduce the potential for operator contamination.\nMany modern sprayers are fitted with a self-fill hose \nfor water and an induction bowl for filling to reduce \nthe risk of operator contamination and environmental pollution caused by pesticide spills. An induction bowl consists of a bowl with a water flushing system, usually at knee-height, eliminating the need to climb onto the sprayer or lift pesticide containers over head. Induction \nbowls usually contain an integral rinsing system to clean \nempty containers. There is also a trend towards closed-\ntransfer devices, a control that connects the pesticide \ncontainer directly to a lid on the sprayer or induction \nbowl, again reducing the risk of contamination for the operator.\nSprayer Agitators\nTank agitation is extremely important to ensure that \nchemicals are well mixed and remain in solution (tank \ncontents can settle out if agitation is insufficient or fails). \nThe sprayer pump typically provides both flow for agita -\ntion and flow to the nozzles.\nSprayer Pumps\nA sprayer pump should have a high capacity to ensure \na good flow to the nozzles as well as providing good \nagitation for the tank contents.\nOutlet\nFig. 11.2  A Piston pump, B Diaphragm pump, and C Centrifugal pump.Impeller \n(rotates)InletOutlet Inlet\nDiaphragmInlet Outlet\nPiston\nA B C\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

It must be stressed that too large a droplet will result in poor coverage, as much of the target will be missed; too fine a droplet will result in \noff-target drift and, equally important, lead to evaporation \nof droplets prior to reaching the target, especially in hot weather. A droplet with twice the diameter of another \nhas four times the area and eight times the volume. \nEight small droplets having the same total volume as \none larger droplet will provide twice the coverage of the \nlarger droplet. Conversely, for the same volume of liquid, \nwhen you halve the diameter of a droplet you increase the number of droplets eight-fold. For example, when a single 200 micron droplet is halved to 100 microns, you disperse its liquid into eight of these smaller droplets. \nHalve them again to 50 microns and you now get 64 \ndroplets, etc. (see figure 11.5).\nHydraulic nozzles regulate the spray by the orifice \nsize in the nozzle tip and the pressure of the system. \nLow pressure and a large hole create large droplets, small \norifices and high pressures create small droplets. As the liquid passes through the orifice, the pressure forces the liquid to break up into droplets in the range of 10\u2013350 microns (1 micron = 1\u204425,000 of an inch, 100 microns is \nthe typical thickness of human hair). Application rate or flow rate is adjusted by changing nozzles.\nAir-shear nozzles are found on some airblast sprayers \nand use the airstream to break up the spray liquid into \nfine droplets. The air passes a shear plate at 150\u2013400 \nmph. Air-shear nozzles operate at low pressures, 15\u201335 psi and, as a result, have very low wear rates. The simple \ndesign is popular with some growers, and changing \napplication rate or flow rate is only a matter of regulating \nliquid flow to the outlet via a valve or a disc with holes in it. However, the high-speed air can create many fine droplets which can lead to drift problems, especially if there is very little canopy present.\nNozzle Selection Technique\nCorrect nozzle selection is one of the most important, yet \ninexpensive, aspects of pesticide application. A nozzle\u2019s droplet size spectrum determines spray deposition and drift. Small droplets, less than 100 microns, drift in the \nair, whereas larger droplets, over 300 microns, tend to \nbounce off of leaves. A number of pesticide manufacturers have adopted \nthe ASAE/BCPC nozzle selection system and now state \non the pesticide label the spray classification needed for their product. Reference nozzles, tested in a laboratory \nusing a laser analyzer, are classified according to the \ncharacteristics of the spray produced. Very fine, fine, \nmedium, coarse, and very coarse are the categories of \nspray. Label recommendations now make nozzle selection \nfar easier for the sprayer operator. A general guideline to follow for nozzle selection is:\n\u2022 Fine spray quality for fungicides and insecticides\n\u2022 Medium spray quality for herbicides\n\u2022 Coarse spray quality for pre-emergent sprays\nWeather conditions, particularly wind and its effect \nupon drift, must always be taken into consideration when \nselecting nozzles. If the label or supplier makes no rec -\nommendation concerning nozzles or spray quality, then a decision on desired spray quality must be made by the applicator, taking three matters into consideration:\n\u2022 The target\n\u2022 The product\n\u2022 The risk of drift\nSpray drift has long been a problem on many farms \nand neighboring properties.

Nozzles \nwith 80\u00b0 angle produce coarser droplets than 110\u00b0 at \nthe same flow rate, but 80\u00b0 nozzles require the boom \nto be set at 17\u201319 inches, whereas 110\u00b0 nozzles can be set lower at 15\u201318 inches above the target. (The lower the boom is above the target, the less chance of drift.) Spray quality is fine to medium at 15\u201360 psi.\nPre-orifice flat fan nozzles\u2014 The internal design \nof this nozzle reduces the internal operating pressure \ncompared to a conventional flat fan, resulting in coarser \ndroplets (high pressure creates fine droplets, low pressure \ncreates coarser droplets). The pre-orifice design contains \na metering orifice (pre-orifice) that restricts the amount \nof liquid entering the nozzle. This is what drops the \npressure within the nozzle. A number of manufactur -\ners offer a pre-orifice flat fan, which produces a coarser \nspray at pressures between 30\u201360 psi. Low-drift nozzles \nsuch as the pre-orifice flan fan nozzle can reduce drift by 50%.\nAir Inclusion Nozzles\nAir inclusion, air induction, or venturi nozzles are flat \nfan nozzles with internal venturi to create negative pres-sure inside the nozzle body. Air is drawn into the nozzle \nthrough two holes in the nozzle side, mixing with the spray \nliquid. Air inclusion nozzles reduce drift by allowing air \nto be incorporated into the liquid flow. The -emitte d spray \ncontains large droplets filled with air bubbles and very \nfew smaller, drift-prone droplets. The droplets shatter on \nimpact with a leaf, the air bubble absorbing the energy, and \nproduce similar coverage to finer, conventional nozzles. \nHollow Cone Nozzles\nWith hollow cone nozzles, the spray is confined at the \nouter edge of the conical pattern, the cone being formed \nby passages in a swirl plate or core to create a swirling motion. A disc with a hole in it forms the second part \nof the hollow cone nozzle. Varying flow rates are created \nby changing the disc (hole size), swirl plate, and system pressure. Most airblast sprayers are fitted with hydraulic \nhollow cone nozzles. The nozzles must be turned towards the target, and the airstream deflected towards the canopy, \nto maximize deposition and minimize drift. \nNozzle wear\nAs liquid passes through the nozzle tip orifice, the tip will \nwear. The rate of wear depends upon three major factors, \nnozzle material, pressure, and the products used. Nozzle \nmaterial greatly affects wear rates. Brass and inexpensive \nplastics wear rapidly due to their soft material. Stain -\nless steel and some high-quality plastics will last longer. Ceramic is the longest-lasting material. High operating pressure increases nozzle wear rates. Materials made of \ncoarse powders cause nozzles to wear rapidly.

The types of crop sprayer most commonly used \nare hydraulic boom sprayers for applying herbicides to \ncontrol weeds, and vertical boom and airblast canopy \nsprayers to apply fungicides and insecticides to canes, \nfoliage, and fruit.\nAirblast and Directed-deposition Sprayers\nAirblast and directed-deposition sprayers are either \nmounted on the 3-point linkage system of the tractor \nor are mounted on a trailer (figure 11.6). Mounted \nsprayers are lighter, causing less soil compaction, and \nare easy to maneuver. Care must be taken to prevent \noverturning when operating on hilly land. Weights are \noften added as ballast to lower the centre of gravity \nof the tractor and counter-balance the weight of the \nsprayer.

If the required application rate does not correspond to the actual rate \nmeasured, various  adjust ments (pressure, travel speed, \nflow rate, nozzle size, spacing, etc.) are made until they are comparable. \nThe application rate, in gallons per acre (GPA), is \ndetermined by:\n Forward speed\n Pressure\n Nozzle tip orifice size \nTo ensure accurate application, sprayers should be \ncalibrated pre-season and during the season to be sure \nproducts are being applied at the desired application rate. \nCalibration should also be done before new nozzles are \nused for the first time or whenever pressure or speed is adjusted. Calibration requires only a few minutes and is time well spent (and potentially money saved by not applying too much or too little product to the target). \nImportant! Clean your sprayer thoroughly before beginning \ncalibration and use only clean water during this process. Be \nsure to wear personal protective equipment (PPE)!\nPre-Calibration Check\nThe sprayer must be operating properly before calibrating \nit. Check the following before you begin:\n 1. Check and clean all nozzles and screens. Replace \nany that are damaged.\n 2. Observe nozzle patterns using water; they \nshould be continuously smooth with no skips or heavy streams. If more than one or two are suspect, they probably all need replacing.\n 3. Check the nozzles and their arrangement on the manifold. Follow manufacturers\u2019 recommenda-tions. Generally nozzles in the bottom of the air stream have lower flow rates.\n 4. Check the pressure gauge. Pressure should be \nstable and at the desired level for spraying.\nAirblast Sprayer Calibration Procedure\nStep 1 . Determine the forward speed of the sprayer (see \nsidebar) in miles per hour (MPH).\nStep 2. Check nozzle output.\n a) Make sure your sprayer is c lean, and use only \nclean water! Connect hoses to each of the \nnozzles and, using a stop watch, measure the flow from each individual nozzle for one minute into a calibrated jug or container.\n b) Compare your nozzle output at a given pressure \nwith the manufacturer\u2019s output in a nozzle cata-logue, or find the gallons per acre (GPA) listed on the label and use the following formula to \ndetermine the flow in gallons per minute (GPM):\n Speed (mph)  \u00d7 width (ft)  \u00d7 GPA  = FLOW _____________________________\n  495\n c) Replace all nozzle tips which are less than 90% \naccurate.\n d) Remember to compare output from no zzles on \neach side of the sprayer.\nExample\nIf a grower wishes to apply 50 gallons/acre at 3 mph \non rows spaced at 10 feet apart, the total required through \nthe nozzles will be:\n  3 mph  \u00d7 10 ft  \u00d7 50 GPA  = 3.03 gal/min _______________________\n  495\nDetermining the forward speed of the sprayer \n(Use for airblast or boom sprayer calibration.)\nMark out a 100-foot course with a stake at each end.

Faulty sprayers contribute to increased drift levels, \nand waste money through inefficiency and overuse of \nchemicals. \nSprayers must be regularly checked over to ensure \nthat proper maintenance has been carried out and that \nno outstanding repairs need to be done. Before attempt -\ning any work on a machine make sure that it is fully \nsupported on stands, it has been fully cleaned, and that all necessary protective clothing is on hand.\nThe cost of good maintenance is soon recovered. \nFor example, replacing a faulty pressure gauge which \nhas been indicating at 15% below the actual pressure \nwill pay for itself in about two hours\u2019 operation. Main -\ntenance measures such as fitting a new set of nozzles \nat the beginning of each season will also save money. \nEven when there is as little as 5% over-application, the cost of a new set of nozzles would be recovered in less than a day\u2019s work.CAUTION\n\u2022 Take great care when adjusting a sprayer while the \ntractor engine is running.\n\u2022 Engage the handbrake whenever leaving the tractor \nseat.\nFitting the sprayer to the tractor\nThe selected tractor must always be powerful enough \nto operate the sprayer efficiently under the working \nconditions that will be encountered. All its external \nservices\u2014hydraulic, electrical, and pneumatic\u2014must be \nclean and in good working order. Tractors fitted with cabs \nmust have efficient air filtration systems. All protective \nguards must be in place. Trailer-mounted sprayers are \noften close-coupled to the tractor, so it is essential that \nthe drawbar and the PTO shaft are correctly adjusted for \nturning. PTO shafts must be disengaged when making very tight turns.\nChecking the operation of the sprayer\nPartially fill the tank with clean water and move the \nsprayer to unplanted ground. Remove the nozzles. \nAlthough not using any chemical at this point, get into the habit of wearing a coverall, gloves, and a face visor \nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

Flush through the spray \nlines, then switch off the tractor. Refit the nozzles and check the liquid system again for leaks.\nPre-season maintenance\nBefore you begin spraying, the following components \nshould be checked:\n\u2751 Hoses\n Should be checked for splits and cracks, particularly \nwhere booms fold, ensure connections are water-\ntight. \n\u2751 Filters\n Check for leaks, damage, and missing filter elements \nand seals.\n\u2751 Tank\n Inspect for fractures and any other damage, ensure \nthat the tank sits firmly in its mount and that the \nsecuring straps are correctly adjusted. Agitation is \nvery important; check that it is functioning properly \nand that the tank is clean.\n\u2751 Controls\n Check the control circuitry (electrical, hydraulic, or \nair) for correct operation and for both internal and external leaks.\n\u2751 Pump\n Ensure that the lubrication levels are correct and that \nthe air pressure in the pulsation chamber (if fitted) is at the recommended level. Check that the pump rotates freely without friction or noise.\n\u2751 Pressure Gauge\n The pressure gauge is vital for indicating whether the \nnozzles are delivering the correct amount of chemical \nper unit time while spraying. Be sure it is operating accurately.\n\u2751 Boom\n The boom suspension must operate smoothly to ensure \na stable \u201cnozzle platform.\u201d Check the boom movement \nand stability, as well as the boom folding mechanism. \nInspect the break backs for correct operation.\u2751 Anti-drip valves\n Avoid leaks by keeping small anti-drip valves, above \nor to one side of each nozzle, in good repair. Damaged \ndiaphragms and seats will lead to faulty functioning. \nExamine all units under pressure to test for leaks and \ncorrect cut-off action.\n\u2751 Nozzles\n Ensure that all nozzles are the same model/size and \nare in good condition with no evidence of streaks or irregularities in the spray pattern. All nozzles must \nbe clean and free from obstruction. ( Note : Clean \nwith a soft brush or airline\u2014don\u2019t damage nozzles \nby using wires or pins.) Replace any nozzles that \ndeliver \u00b110% of the manufacturer\u2019s chart value.\nRoutine maintenance\nThe following checks should be carried out routinely:\n 1. All hoses are tightly connected and free from \nsharp bends; cracked or damaged hoses must be \nreplaced.\n 2. All controls move freely and are fully adjustable.\n 3. Pressure gauge reads zero.\n 4. The pump can be turned over by hand.\n 5. Air pressure in pump accumulator (if fitted) is \ncorrectly adjusted.\n 6. Drain plugs and clean filters are in position.\n 7. Tires on trailer-mounted machines are sound \nand correctly inflated; wheel nuts are tight.\nSpray Equipment for Small Plantings\nAlthough powered sprayers make bramble spraying easy \nand fast, they are relatively expensive and must be used on fairly large acreage to be economically justified. This \nacreage may include brambles or other crops, but the \nfixed (ownership) costs must be spread over many acres, \neven for the smaller air-blast units to be feasible. Grow -\ners with smaller plantings should explore alternative, less \nexpensive spraying equipment.\nHand-Held Sprayers\nHydraulic hand-held sprayers or \u201chandgun\u201d sprayers may \nbe equipped with single or multiple nozzles (figure 11.12). \nThe multiple-nozzle guns are actually miniature hand-held \nbooms. Handguns are connected by a relatively long hose \nto a powered pump.

The energy of the droplet\u2019s \nvelocity at the nozzle discharge projects the spray to \nthe target. The farther the target is from the handgun, \nthe higher the pressure needed to provide enough force to carry droplets to the target. However, as pressure is increased, smaller droplets are produced, which tend to slow more quickly.\nOften, two people perform handgun spraying, one \noperating the handgun and one driving the tractor or \nother vehicle used to transport the sprayer through the field. This is convenient but increases labor needs. The \nquality of handgun spraying depends on the operator. \nMuch practice is needed to become skillful enough to \nobtain a thorough coverage for adequate pest control \nwithout overspraying, and to obtain a uniform application \nrate. Factors such as temperature, fatigue, slope of the terrain, walking surface, and length and weight of the hose can increase the difficulty of handgun spraying.\nKnapsack Sprayers\nAnother sprayer suitable for small plantings up to about \n\u00bc acre is the knapsack sprayer (figure 11.13). They are also useful for making spot treatments where the pest \nproblem is not spread across the entire field. This sprayer \nis operated manually and is carried on the operator\u2019s back \nwith shoulder straps. Sprayer parts include the basic parts \nof most sprayers: a tank to hold the spray mix, a pump \nor pressurized gas canister to produce pressure and flow, \ncontrols to regulate flow, and an atomizer.\nTanks, which are typically plastic or steel, range from three to five gallons in size. Some have a mechanical agi -\ntator that moves when the pump is used to provide some \nmixing; others may have jet agitation. Before spraying, the entire sprayer can be shaken to ensure good mixing.\nHand-pump sprayers have a built-in piston or dia -\nphragm pump. Some models can be adapted to either \nleft- or right-handed pumping, with the free hand operat-\ning the flow control valve and the nozzle. The pumps are \npositive-displacement types and can produce relatively \nhigh pressures. There is only a very small chamber where \nthe liquid is under pressure, which makes the sprayer a \u201cpump-as-you-go\u201d system.\nThe distribution system includes an on/off valve, usu -\nally with a pistol-grip handle, and one or more nozzles. \nThe nozzle is often mounted at an angle on a 16- to \n20-inch wand to aid spray placement on the plants. Some \ndesigns provide for interchangeable nozzle tips so that nozzles can be better matched to the job.\nUsing a knapsack sprayer to spray raspberries is a \ntime- and labor-intensive method. From the standpoint \nof equipment investment, the cost is low, but the capac -\nity is also very low. However, where labor is a minimal consideration, such as for many homeowners and hob-byists, the knapsack sprayer is effective, if properly used. Since the operator controls the travel speed, variations in application rate similar to those caused by handgun systems can be expected.

It is not prac -\ntical to apply a rate close to 100 gallons per acre with \na hand sprayer. \nPowered Knapsack Sprayer \nAnother version of the knapsack sprayer has a very small \nengine and fan to create a hand-carried air-assist sprayer. \nThis sprayer is also known as a motorized knapsack mist \nblower (figure 11.14).\nPowered knapsack sprayers are equipped with 3- to \n5-horsepower engines. Two-stroke cycle engines are \nused to minimize the weight; however, they require a \ngasoline/oil mixture for fuel. Operators should follow \nthe manufacturer\u2019s recommendation on the oil-to-fuel \nratio, which may be given on the fuel tank or its cap. \nThe engines operate at 5,800 to 8,000 rpm and are \nnoisy\u2014operators should wear ear protection. These spray -\ners are much heavier than manual models, weighing 17 to 25 pounds when empty.\nThe engine operates a centrifugal fan that delivers \n200 to 450 cubic feet of air per minute. The discharge \nvelocity is usually over 200 miles per hour. With this \nhigh velocity, air shear nozzles are practical and often \nused. However, hydraulic orifice and rotary nozzles are \nalso used to form and inject the droplets into the air \nstream. The air from the fan is fed through a flexible tube with an air nozzle on the end. The operator con -\ntrols the direction of the air stream to place the spray \non the target. Because of the high discharge velocity, the \nair nozzle should be at least 6 feet from plants. The air stream should be aimed downwind so that natural cur -\nrents assist in dispersing droplets away from the operator. \nSpraying into even a slight wind may result in droplets \nbeing blown back onto the operator. Take care not to \noverspray the target, since it is often difficult to observe the spray coverage produced by these sprayers.\nMotorized knapsack mist blowers can spray raspber -\nries much faster than manual sprayers. The air stream \nwill assist in delivery and coverage, even at lower appli -\ncation rates. However, the area that can be sprayed is \nstill limited since the sprayer tanks are about the same \nsize or even smaller than those on manual sprayers. \nTherefore, a full tank will cover only a relatively small \narea, and much time is required to refill the tank and \nmeasure chemicals.\nHand Sprayer Calibration\nHand sprayers need to be calibrated for the same reasons \nas power sprayers. The operator must first determine the \npercentage of an acre covered by one tank full of spray \nmix. By multiplying this percentage by the recommended \napplication rate per acre, the operator can easily calcu -\nlate the amount of chemical required per tank. Before \ncalibrating a sprayer, operate it with only water to be \nsure all parts are properly working.\nHandguns, manual knapsack sprayers, motorized \nknapsack sprayers, and other hand sprayers can be cali -\nbrated with the following method:\n 1. Select a calibration plot (row length) that repre -\nsents 1\u2044100 to 1\u204420 acre. A bigger plot will produce more accurate results. There are 43,560 square feet in an acre; therefore, row length per acre is 43,560 square feet divided by the row spacing (feet). For example, if the raspberries are planted in rows 10 feet apart, then there are 43,560 square feet \u00f7 10 feet = 4,356 feet of row per acre. There are approximately 44 feet (4,356 \u00f7 100) of row in 1\u2044100 of an acre, and 220 feet (4,3560 \u00f7 20) in 1\u204420 acre.\n 2.

This requires good judgment; \nan inexperienced operator should get help or training from an experienced or trained pesti-cide applicator. The goal is to provide coverage to the entire plant without reaching the point of runoff (spray mix dripping from plants) to avoid waste and potential pollution.\n 3. Measure the amount of water required to refill \nthe sprayer tank to the previous level. Calculate the application rate by dividing the amount of water used by the area covered. For example, if 1.5 quarts were applied to 1\u2044100 of an acre, the actual application rate is 37.5 gallons per acre (1.5 quarts \u00f7 4 quarts per gallon \u00f7 1\u2044100 acre).\nA preferred alternate method for hydraulic handgun \nsprayers (not mist sprayers) (figure 11.13, page 128) is a modification of the above method.\n 1. Same as step 1 above.\n 2. Same as step 2 above, but also use a stopwatch \nto determine the time required to spray the cali-bration plot as measured.\n 3. With the sprayer in place, spray into a container \nfor the time measured in step 2. Be sure to collect all the water for the exact time period. The water in the container will be the same amount applied to the calibration plot. Calculate the application rate as described in step 3 above.\nHand Sprayer Operation\nHand sprayers require much more labor to operate than \nthe tractor-powered units, so hand sprayers are limited to \nsmall plantings. High application rates similar to those \nachieved with the powered sprayers are feasible with \nthe powered handgun, because the spray mix is carried \nby the tractor or a trailer, and the pump is powered. \nHowever, with knapsack sprayers it is not practical to \nuse such high rates.\nA major problem with hand sprayers is the inability \nof an operator to walk along a row at a uniform rate. \nVariation in walking speed will vary the application \nrate. However, an experienced applicator may be able to compensate for variations of plant density in the plant \nrow. For example, if a plant is missing in a row, the \noperator can skip that space and move immediately to the next plant. Inexperienced operators should practice with water until they can apply a spray uniformly at the recommended rate.\nHand sprayers necessarily place the operator near the \nnozzles and discharge point of the sprayer. This makes \noperator protection very important. Basic protection \nincludes a hat, long-sleeved shirt, and trousers, or a spray \nsuit. Depending on the toxicity of the chemicals, other protective gear, such as a respirator, goggles, waterproof \ngloves, or waterproof boots, may be needed. All operators \nshould read the labels and follow directions for the specific \nmaterial being applied. The spray should be discharged \nwith the wind so that droplets are carried away from \nthe operator. If spray is directed into the wind, some \nwill be blown back onto the operator.\nDrift can be a problem with hand sprayers and may \nbe even more important where lower application rates are \nused. Since the spray mix is more concentrated, any loss \nmeans more active ingredient is lost. The best solution \nis to spray only when winds are slight or blowing at less \nthan 5 miles per hour. Operators should use as low a pres -\nsure and as large an orifice as is practical to minimize the \nnumber of small droplets formed. Adding a drift-control \nadditive to the spray mix may also be helpful.\nSprayer Maintenance\nLike all other equipment, sprayers must be kept in good \nworking order to last a long time. Cleaning is especially \nimportant because of the chemicals used. A very thorough \ncleaning should be performed whenever chemicals are changed and at the end of each spraying season. Spray -\ners must be protected from corrosion and freezing in \nstorage during the off season.\nCleaning\nAll sprayers must be cleaned to prevent corrosion, cross \ncontamination of pesticides, and crop injury.

It is important to consider both characteristics \nin choosing cultivars for a specific market. Storage life \nis that time that a berry is stored at low temperatures, while shelf life refers to the period of time at ambient \ntemperatures with or without storage (e.g., at a road -\nside stand or supermarket). A cultivar with an extended storage life would not be ideal for a roadside stand or \nsupermarket if its berry shelf life was limited, as the \nfruit could deteriorate before it could be sold. This same cultivar might be good for a pick-your-own operation if customers promptly refrigerate fruit.\nIn a pick-your-own operation, the intensity of flavor \nthat the fruit develops on the plant may be the principal \nconsideration in choosing cultivars. Consumers harvest the \nfruit and eat them within a short time period. However, if \nfruit are to be marketed at the retail level, both fruit firm -\nness and shipping ability becomes more important as the \nfruit have to withstand handling operations. Sometimes, \nflavor intensity is compromised for handling purposes.Selecting a site that will provide good microclimactic \nconditions, such as good air drainage, and planting in a \nrow orientation parallel to the prevailing summer winds \nwill maximize plant health and improve the quality of \nharvested fruit. Proper plant densities will reduce disease \npressure on fruit. Rain and dew increase the likeliness \nof infection by fungi, but this moisture will evaporate \nmore quickly in a sparse canopy with good air circulation. \nSimilarly, proper irrigation management (i.e., using drip \nirrigation) can minimize decay that might be induced from contact of fruit with water.\nNutrition is also an important component of good stor -\nage life. Fruit from plants that are nutritionally stressed, either because of under- or over-supply of fertilizer, will have a shorter storage potential than fruit from healthy \nplants. Adequate potassium and calcium should be avail -\nable to the plant to assure good fruit health, and nitrogen \nshould not be too high. While nitrogen encourages plant \ngrowth, high nitrogen availability can be associated with \nsofter and faster-ripening fruit, and subsequently increased \nsusceptibility to gray mold infection. Leaf analysis can \nbe helpful in diagnosing deficiencies and, thereby, can \nhelp in fine-tuning the fertilizer program (see \u201cSoil and Nutrient Management,\u201d chapter seven).\nFungicides applied during bloom and at petal fall can \nreduce the number of moldy berries. Gray mold (Botrytis \ncinerea) readily infects senescent petals and grows from \nthe petals into developing fruit. Affected berries may \nhave no visible signs of infection until harvest. Thus, \ntimely petal fall sprays are essential, especially during \ndamp, humid weather.\nSome insects cause only minor physical damage when \nfeeding on the fruit, but even small wounds are sites for \nfungal infection. Certain insects may spread bacteria \nand fungi from fruit to fruit. If insecticides are used \nto control pests, be sure to consider days-to-harvest \nrestrictions.\n 132 Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide    CHAPTER TWELVE\nHarvesting, Handling, and  \nTransporting Fresh Fruit\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

Fruit harvested before the fully \nripe stage may have a longer storage and/or shelf life than those harvested at the fully ripe or overripe stage. However, there is usually a compromise between flavor \nand storage potential. Fruits harvested at a less ripe stage \nare unlikely to develop the same intense flavor as fruits harvested at the fully ripe stage. Appropriate cultivars \nshould be selected to ensure that adequate flavor is \nrealized for the type of operation. For example, some \nraspberry  cultivars\u2014e.g., Canby and Reveille\u2014do not \nappear to be suited for commercial harvest because of poor flavor, soft berries, or dark color.\nQuality of fresh market bramble berries usually \ndeclines as the season progresses. Be sure your marketing \nchannels are open before the first and highest quality berries of the season are ripe.\nBecause raspberries ripen quickly and non-uniformly, \nfrequent harvesting of the field (once every two days) is \ncritical. Most raspberries grown in the East are harvested \nby hand for the fresh market as opposed to mechani-cally harvested for processing (figure 12.1). Pickers may need to be trained to identify the proper ripening stage and berry appearance for harvesting. The best stage of maturity for the wholesale fresh raspberry market occurs \nwhen the berry first becomes completely red, but before any darker colors develop. Blackberries and raspberries should pull easily from the receptacle, yet be firm and not mushy.\nBerries should not be touched before harvest. They \nare extremely fragile and easily damaged during harvest, \ne.g., by finger pressure, but the damage may not be vis -\nible until later. Studies in California have shown that the \npercentage of damaged fruit may vary significantly from \none picker to another, and differences may be so great as to mask any other causes of deterioration. Training \npickers is critical. Only undamaged berries with good \nappearance should be placed in the pack, and harvested fruit should not be exposed to direct sunlight. Growers might also find it economically worthwhile to turn the plug holes under when packing the top layer to offer a more attractive presentation.\nMixed ripening stages in the pack are less attractive \nin the marketplace. Under-ripe berries will be slow to develop acceptable color, whereas overripe berries lose their attractive \u201cglossiness\u201d and are susceptible to mold. Once the mold growing on overripe berries sporulates, \nlarge amounts of inoculum can infect other ripening \nfruit. Overripe berries also attract ants, wasps, and other \npests. Pick overripe berries off plants and do not dispose \nof them near the field. It may be more economical in \nthe long run to pay pickers to harvest rotten as well as marketable fruit, but at different times. Rotten berries must not be allowed to contaminate marketable berries with fungal spores.\nPlace only marketable berries into commercial con -\ntainers. Marketable raspberries are at least 3 grams (0.1 \nounce) in size and have no blemishes. Marketable black -\nberries are at least 5 grams (0.2 ounce) in size and have \nno blemishes. Small, overripe, or defective berries can be \nused for processing. This sorting process is best done in the field so berries are handled only once. Unlike many other fruits, grading standards do not exist for bramble berries, so it is less efficient to bring berries to a packing line for sorting and packaging.\nThe standard container for raspberries and blackberries \nat the supermarket is \u00bd pint, or 6 ounces. Pick-your-own \noperators usually offer pint containers to customers. Wide, \nshallow containers are better than deep containers. Never \nuse a container which will hold more than four layers of \n Fig. 12.1  Mechanical harvester for raspberries.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

Pulp containers are inexpensive \nbut stain easily, and may not be preferred by the market. \nWooden containers also stain and are expensive. Solid, clear, vented, plastic containers (polystyrene clamshells) \nhave become increasingly standard; they do not stain, \nthey significantly reduce moisture loss when used with a cap, they enable customers to see all the berries they purchase, and they are inexpensive.\nPostharvest Handling\nRespiration of fruit is the process by which food reserves \nare converted into energy. The process uses carbohydrates \nand oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, heat and water, \nand therefore can result in shrinkage, reduced soluble \nsolids (sugars), and deterioration. Good postharvest \nhandling techniques will reduce the rate of respiration and, therefore, extend the life of the fruit.\nThe presence of ethylene, produced by a variety of \nsources including combustion engines, fruit such as \napples, and any decayed and injured fruit, can stimulate respiration rates. Gray mold growth can also be stimu -\nlated by ethylene. Color of raspberries can be adversely affected by ethylene as it causes red fruit to darken to purple-red.\nThe rate of respiration, or the speed at which fruit \ndeteriorate, can be measured by the amount of carbon \ndioxide produced per weight of fruit over time. Berry \nfruit, especially raspberries and blackberries, have much \nhigher rates of respiration than fruit such as oranges and \napples, which are stored for much longer time periods. \nCooling berries after harvest is the most effective action \na grower can take to maintain fruit quality. Each 10\u00b0F reduction in temperature reduces the respiration rate of fruit by approximately 50% (Table 12.1). At 77\u00b0F and \n30% relative humidity, fruit will lose water thirty-five \ntimes faster than it would at 32\u00b0F and 90% relative \nhumidity. Clearly, prompt cooling and maintenance of proper temperatures and humidity are essential.\nFor blackberries, forced-air cooling to 41\u00b0F within \nfour hours is recommended, and fruit should be trans -\nported at refrigeration temperatures of 41\u00b0F or less. \nFruit can be held for two to fourteen days, depending on the cultivar, at 31 to 32\u00b0F with more than 90% rela-tive humidity (RH).\nRaspberries should be forced-air cooled to 34\u00b0F as \nsoon as possible, no later than twelve hours after harvest. \nFruit should be held for no more than two to five days, \ndepending on the cultivar, at 31 to 32\u00b0F with more \nthan 90% RH.\nBerries will not freeze at 31\u00b0F because the sugars \nin the fruit lower the freezing point. Maintaining the \nstorage at a slightly warmer temperature (32\u00b0F) will \nallow some room for error. However, major shippers \nreport that storage at 40\u00b0F, as opposed to 30\u00b0F, reduces shelf life by 50%.\nCooling Methods\nOnly passive or room cooling, and force-air cooling are suitable for raspberries and blackberries because of their \ndelicate nature and the need to avoid contact with water. \nThe method of choice for cooling is forced-air cooling. \nThe reason for this becomes quite obvious when compar -\ning the \u201c 7\u20448 cooling time\u201d (the number of hours it takes to \nremove seven-eighths of the field heat) of forced-air and \npassive cooling methods.

Large growers may have \na separate forced-air cooling facility \nspecifically designed for removing \nfield heat, but inexpensive, effec -\ntive improvisations can be adapted \nfor any cold storage. If a grower \nonly has a walk-in cooler, recently \npicked flats of berries can be set into \na cardboard box that is opened at \nboth ends, and a household fan can \nthen be placed at one end of the \nbox to draw air through the flats. \nOnce the berries are cool, flats can \nbe removed from the cardboard and \nwrapped in plastic.\nOperation of a precooling system, \nwhether on a small or large scale, \nrequires that the cooling rate of the fruit be followed \nby checking flesh temperatures throughout the process. \nThe fan should be cut off when the flesh temperature is within 5\u00b0F of the desired temperature to avoid dehydra -\ntion of the berries.\nThe selection of a cooling unit is very important \nwhen a cooler is designed. If the temperature difference \nbetween the air and the cooling unit is too large, then the \ncondensers will accumulate ice from moisture in the air. \nThis drying of the air would not cause a problem for dry \ngoods but would severely dehydrate fruit. The atmosphere \naround the fruit should be humid to prevent shrinkage, so a cooler should be able to maintain a relative humid -\nity of 90\u201395% at 32\u00b0F. These types of coolers are more \nexpensive and less common than those for dry goods. \nConsult a refrigeration specialist for help with selecting a cooling unit and building a storage facility.\nWhatever method is used for cooling, condensation \ncan be a problem. Cold fruit removed from storage on a warm day will become moist with condensation very \nquickly, resulting in loss of \u201cgloss\u201d and development \nof warm, moist conditions favorable to fungal decay. \nCondensation can be avoided, however. The best way is \nto maintain refrigeration during the entire marketing \nperiod; but this requires facilities for storage, transport, and display that many small producers do not have.\nA simple method to avoid condensation is to cover flats or pallets with plastic before they are \nbrought out from cold storage. The \nplastic must be left on until the ber -\nries warm to a temperature above the \ndewpoint. Remember that the plastic \nmust be removed if fruits are going to \nbe refrigerated, as leaving the plastic \nin place will cause condensation to \nform inside the bag and create an \nenvironment for fungal decay.\nHigh carbon dioxide concen -\ntrations, typically between 10 and \n20% (in 5\u201310% oxygen), can reduce \nsoftening and fungal decay, and \nhelp maintain the quality of berries. \nHowever, the financial investment \nrequired for controlled atmosphere (CA) storage has limited the use of this storage method to extend rasp-\nberry and blackberry storage life. Also, most CA storages \nthat are available have been built for large volume crops \nsuch as apples. Small portable units that can extend shelf \nlife by several days are becoming available, but may still not \nbe economically feasible. It is also important to recognize \nthat different varieties respond very differently to high carbon dioxide atmospheres, and cultivar selection will be important if this technology is to be used.\nComponents of Forced-Air Cooling\n 1. Vented containers to allow air to flow past fruit\n 2. Fan capacity appropriate to the volume of fruit being cooled (2 cubic feet per minute per pound of fruit)\n 3. Air ducts to deliver cool air to the fruit and warm air back to the coils\n 4. Control of escaping air by plugging gaps and tarping the containers\nTransporting Berries to Market\nMany steps in the distribution chain can negatively \naffect fruit quality. It is estimated that deterioration \nfrom harvest to the consumer\u2019s table accounts for 40% \nof the berries lost. These losses occur from farmer to \nwholesaler, from wholesaler to retailer, and from retailer to consumer. Much of these losses are due to poor han -\ndling of berries after harvest.\nFig. 12.2  Forced air cooling unit.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

Mishandling, \neither by rough handling or by poor \ntemperature management, at any \npoint along this route can result in \nunacceptable loss of quality.\nMinimize the number of handling steps from field to \ndisplay. Berries should remain cold and wrapped during \neach phase of transportation. Never allow the berries \nto sit on unrefrigerated loading docks. When loading a truck, stack flats on a palette and away from the truck \nwalls (figure 12.3). Ensure that cold air is free to circulate \naround the sides of the pallet and across the top and \nbottom. When flats of fruit are allowed to touch the \nfloor or side walls, temperatures in the flats can rise as much as 20\u00b0F. Do not stack flats directly over the rear \nwheels, and use strapping or stretch film around each \npallet to stabilize the load. Transit vibrations can be \nreduced by using trucks equipped with air-suspension \nsystems rather than spring systems.\nTruck mechanical refrigeration equipment is designed \nto maintain temperature but currently lacks the air flow \nand refrigeration capacity for rapid cooling. Temperature \nregulating equipment in trucks does not have the accuracy \nto achieve temperatures below 40\u00b0F without danger of freezing. Furthermore, high-density loads are used to \nminimize transportation costs, even though they inhibit \ncooling during transit. Therefore, thorough product cool -\ning before loading is very important. If possible, make sure berries are the last product in and first product out \nof the truck. Often, though, the transportation of berries \nis beyond the control of the grower. To develop new and \ndistant markets, receivers must be educated in proper \nhandling procedures. Personal contact with the receiver before the first delivery is often useful. In other cases, handling instructions may be attached to the flats.\nBerries should be allowed to warm only when they are \nready for display to consumers and before removing the plastic wrap over the flats. Any condensation will then form on the outside of the plastic wrap rather than on the berries inside. Fruit should be stored and displayed \nat the coldest refrigeration temperature possible, with \nno mist. As little as one day at room temperature can stimulate the growth of gray mold.\nFig. 12.3  A Improper loading of flats within a truck\u2014flats are in \ncontact with the floor and walls; B Proper loading\u2014flats are not \nin contact with floor and walls and cold air is free to circulate.A\n B\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

This is the product that growers must promote and market to be competitive\u2014not a low-priced produce item. Super -\nmarkets are able to obtain large volumes of product and sell them for less than the local farmer can. However, \nsupermarkets cannot offer a pleasant farm experience, \neven though many are now designing the produce sec -\ntion to resemble a farm market and are even featuring photos of local farmers in the stores.\nQuality stands above all else in establishing and \nmaintaining a profitable bramble fruit farm. But quality includes more than just the fruit; it includes the entire \nexperience that is involved with obtaining the berries. For \npick-your-own farms, this includes everything from the parking area to the greeter to clean restrooms to weed-free fields. For farm markets, it is the clean, wholesome atmosphere and friendly sales clerk, in addition to the product, that will bring return customers. High-quality fruit from a neat, efficient farm sold in a friendly atmo -\nsphere will reap much more profit than poorly handled, unsorted fruit in a cluttered farm stand.\nMarketing Options\nWhich marketing channel you use to sell your prod -\nuct will determine the demand for your product, and how you price and promote your products. Invest time into marketing research to determine which marketing \noption is best for you. Consider the following ques -\ntion: Can you produce a better experience or provide a better service to customers in that market than those presently in the business?\nRaspberries and blackberries are typically sold via \none of three marketing channels: customer harvest (pick-your-own); fresh market (retail or wholesale); \nand processed (frozen, jams, jellies, wines, etc.). Each \nof these channels has advantages and disadvantages \nthat should be carefully considered. Most growers use \nmore than one marketing channel, which can be an \nadvantage, as the demand in one market can make up for slack periods in another.\nDue to the short season, no matter what marketing \nchannel is chosen for your berry crop, customer contact \nshould begin early, well before the harvest or picking \nseason. Let buyers know what the product is, the quality \nof the crop, how much will be available, and when it will \nbe available. Bramble growers who invest the time in \nadvance marketing seldom fall into the frantic race to sell fruit before it rots, nor do they have to drop prices below the profit margin to get fruit harvested.\nMarketing Fresh Fruit\nPick-Your-Own (PYO)\nExperience has shown that raspberries and blackberries may not be as popular for PYO as other crops such as strawberries. This is probably due to the higher cost of \nraspberries and blackberries per pound, a greater difficulty \nin harvesting berries, and the later (hotter) season. In \nsome locations, however, these obstacles may not deter \ncustomers, and PYO can be a successful part of an overall \nmarketing strategy.\nSuccess can be highly dependent on a farm\u2019s location. \nIn order to attract enough customers to a PYO farm, \nthe farm is best located within 20 miles of a densely \npopulated area.

Develop-ing a customer base on out-of-the-way farms requires patience, a great \ndeal of promotional effort, including \nletting customers know when the \ncrop is ready, and a reputation for \nproviding a pleasant farm experi -\nence. For example, farm roads to the \nfields must be suitable for customer \nvehicles, or transportation should be supplied. Ample \nparking space should be available as well as toilet facili -\nties, drinking water, shade, and some seating. An easy \naccess area to accommodate the needs of older people or \nthose with disabilities or strollers could attract additional \ncustomers. Some form of entertainment, especially for \nchildren, is becoming standard. Directions and rules \nshould be clearly visible.\nAlthough one of the major advantages of PYO mar -\nketing is reduced harvest labor, field supervisors must \nbe employed to direct and help customers in parking, \nharvesting, and check-out procedures. Supervisors should \nbe courteous and friendly and have a thorough knowl-edge of the farm. Check-out areas should be neat and \nefficient. Customers should not have to wait in long \nlines to pay. \nIt is generally better to charge by fruit weight than \nby volume (for example $2.50 per pound versus $1.90 \nper pint). This will curtail the inevitable arguments as to \nwhat constitutes a \u201cfull\u201d pint and guarantees a fair price to all. On average a pint of raspberries or blackberries weighs 12 ounces. Electronic scales can make weighing proceed very quickly. If standard picking containers are \nsupplied to customers, cashiers can easily subtract the \nweight of the containers and charge only for the fruit. Otherwise, containers must be weighed before custom-ers go into the field. Supplying large picking containers (such as a 2-quart size) versus small containers (such \nas several 1-pint baskets) usually results in customers \npicking more fruit, because they tend to want to fill the container they have regardless of its size. \nPYO farms are a common source of family recreation. \nFamilies tend to pick more fruit, so most operations \nallow children, but growers must ensure that children \nare supervised. Allowing children to pick fruit from the outside rows increases the likelihood that they will be advocates for return trips to the farm. It is also a good \nidea to have alternative amusement for children, such \nas a playground or petting zoo (figure 13.1).\nGrowers are strongly advised to consult their insurance \nagents regarding the potential liabilities involved in a \nPYO operation and to purchase appropriate coverage.\nA bramble crop should be planned to fit into the \noverall farm operation. Add other crops suitable for \nfarm retailing so that the customers will come back to \nthe farm many times each year. For example, an early \nsummer raspberry harvest could come after strawberries \nand be followed by blueberries or vegetables such as \ntomatoes, cucumbers, and sweet corn, and at the end of the season, pumpkins or even Christmas trees. PYO in conjunction with a farm market (even a small stand of pre-picked fruit) can be a powerful draw for customers \nwho want convenience, local produce, and recreation \nall at one location.

A clean, friendly atmo -\nsphere is essential, and consumers \nappreciate the convenience of being \nable to purchase food staples such as \nmilk and bread along with their fruits \nand vegetables. An attractive exterior \nwith a rural flavor is what consumers \nhave come to expect (figure 13.2). Sometimes additional \nservices such as caf\u00e9, ice cream, and/or a petting zoo could \nset the operation out to be a destination for customers. \nAdequate parking is essential for a successful farm market. \nAs with any retail business, location is very important. \nFor growers who do not have a good retail location \nbut would like to retail their berries, a farmers\u2019 market will be a good alternative. By selecting a well-managed \nfarmers\u2019 market, growers can gain the access to consumers \nwithout bearing all the overhead and marketing costs \nof operating a farm market themselves.\nFarmer\u2019s markets are becoming very popular through -\nout North America. Most markets charge fees to sell \nthere and require that all produce be grown within a \ncertain distance from the market. Prices received are \noften higher than at supermarkets because consumers are \nensured that the product is local and fresh. Consumers also have an opportunity to talk directly with the pro -\nducer. Selling at a farmer\u2019s market requires the farmer to \narrive early to set up, and be available all day, usually on a Saturday, unless another person can be hired to do the selling. Some markets will sell on consignment, which eliminates the need to be present all day.\nFresh Market Wholesale\nWholesaling is another option for growers whose opera -\ntion is not adapted to customer harvest or retail. Whole -\nsaling usually involves harvesting large volumes of berries, \ncooling them to prolong shelf life (see \u201cHarvesting, \nHandling, and Transporting Fresh Fruit,\u201d chapter twelve), \nFig. 13.2  Rural farm market.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

Buy -\ners must be contacted well before the harvest season to \nset up delivery schedules, specify container preferences, \nand discuss payment policies. Some outlets may demand \nspecialized handling or packaging. Wholesaling to other \nfarm markets or restaurant chefs are other marketing \nopportunities growers might consider. Due to the spe -\ncialty and perishable nature of brambles, growers could receive higher prices from these markets.\nCombining wholesaling and direct marketing can be \nbeneficial, as long as one of the markets is not getting the \nlow-quality leftovers of the other. If one buyer is receiving \nlower-quality fruit, then that should be clearly understood \nby the buyer, and he or she should pay accordingly.\nPostharvest handling of the fruit is a critical part of \ndealing with the fresh wholesale market. Growers must be able to deliver a high-quality crop with a maximum \nshelf life. This can mean a considerable investment in \npacking, storage, and transportation facilities (\u201cHarvest -\ning, Handling, and Transporting Fresh Fruit,\u201d chapter \ntwelve).\nGrowers should follow up on their shipments to see \nthat they are properly handled in stores. Improper han-dling there can ruin efforts to deliver a good product. A \ngrower should discuss proper procedures with the produce \nmanager, because the grower\u2019s reputation is at stake.\nReducing the Risk of Microbiological Contamination\nConsidering recent concerns over microbiological con -\ntamination of fruits and vegetables, take steps to reduce \nany risks of illness. Many steps can be taken to reduce risks \nof food-borne illness. Refer to www.gaps.cornell.edu  \nfor extensive information. Here are a few of the most \nimportant sources of risk and steps that can be taken to reduce them.\nMost food-borne illnesses originate in fecal matter, \neither from humans or animals; therefore: \n\u2022 Apply manure to fields only after composting \nand prior to planting. Never apply raw manure.\n\u2022 Do not graze livestock next to irrigation ponds. \nTest irrigation water for pathogens.\n\u2022 Do not allow animals or pets into the fields prior \nto or during harvest.\n\u2022 Provide toilets and hand-washing areas for customers \nand workers to use before entering and after leaving \nthe field (same applies to a petting zoo).\u2022 Ensure that water is potable.\n\u2022 Ensure that picking containers are clean or \nwashed frequently.\n\u2022 Keep garbage containers covered.\n\u2022 Do not allow sick people into the field.\n\u2022 Cool produce that is to be stored for any length \nof time.\n\u2022 Ensure that transportation vehicles are clean and \nsanitized.\n\u2022 Mark containers so they can be traced back if \nany problems occur.\nMarketing Processed Fruit\nFreezing\nSelling frozen berries is a good way to sell excess fruit that might otherwise be wasted during the peak of the \nseason. Few families have sufficiently large freezers to \nstore all of the fruit they will consume during the off-season, so selling frozen berries can extend the season and add value to the product.\nWhen berries freeze, ice crystals form inside the cells. \nThe expanding ice crystals rupture the cell membranes, so when the berries thaw, they are softer and more flac -\ncid. To reduce the amount of crystallization, mix berries with sugar prior to freezing. The sugar draws water out of the cells, so less is inside to crystallize. Berries frozen \nin a sugar solution will be more firm upon thawing than \nthose frozen without sugar.\nMost berries are packaged in a container with 6 ounces \nof berries to 4 ounces of concentrated sugar syrup (1 \npart water to 1 part sugar). High-fructose corn syrup \nis also used (4 parts fruit to 1 part syrup).\nFreezing should occur rapidly after harvest to avoid \nlosing flavor and to preserve color. Rapid freezing results \nin smaller ice crystals than slow freezing. IQF (individual \nquick frozen) berries are used in fruit salads because they \nmaintain their integrity after thawing. Many processing plants have the ability to use IQF technologies.\nIndividual states and provinces have regulations \nregarding processing of fruit. In some states, freezing \nis not considered processing, so it does not come under \nguidelines from the health or agricultural and markets departments. Check with authorities about regulations before attempting to freeze berries for later sale.\nThis page is from Raspberry and Blackberry Production Guide: For the Northeast, Midwest, and Eastern Canada, NRAES-35.  \nTo purchase the book, visit www.sare.org or www.nraes.org, or call (607) 255-7654.

This may include undergoing \nregular inspections, purchasing stainless steel equip -\nment, and using water treatments. Contact your state \nor province department of agriculture and/or health \ndepartment for details. \nValue-added products, such as jams and jellies, may \ngenerate a higher profit margin than fresh fruit, but \nthe inputs are much greater. Labor costs will be higher, \nand appropriate cooking tools will be needed as well \nas a steady supply of ingredients, jars, labels, shipping \nboxes, and so forth. Nevertheless, properly processed \nproducts provide the advantage of having year-round, \nquality, locally produced, specialty foods to sell directly \nto consumers or through wholesalers. Specialty foods \nare well suited for distribution in tourism areas such as wine trails, popular parks, and regional fairs.\nJams and Jellies\nJams (made with whole fruits or purees with and without \nseeds), preserves (made with pieces of large fruit), and \njellies (made with filtered juice) comprise four ingredients: \nsugar, fruit, pectin, and acid. A balance among these is important. Fruit naturally contains all four of these, but the amount varies. Therefore, additional amounts must be added to bring the ingredients into balance.\nSugar sweetens the jam, suppresses microbial growth, \nsets the pectin, and makes the product glisten. The sugar \ncontent of a berry is generally between 5% and 15%, while \nthe sugar content of a preserve must be between 65% \nand 69%. Obviously, additional sugar must be added to the fruit to make a preserve. Not all of the added sugar \nshould be sucrose (table sugar) because of its tendency to \ncrystallize. A portion of added sugar should be fructose \n(from corn syrup) or glucose. If the fruit contains enough \nacid, sufficient chemical inversion of sucrose will occur during boiling to make some glucose and fructose from \nthe sucrose; this will prevent crystallization. The standard \ngrade of jelly contains 45 parts fruit to 55 parts sugar. The \nfancy grade is 50/50, while imitation grade is 35/65.\nPectin is part of the cell walls of most fruit, but ripe berries have very little, and what exists is of poor quality for jam making. Green fruit contains more pectin, and \nup to 25% of a commercial jam can contain unripe fruit. \nStill, in most cases commercial pectin must be added \nfor the jelly to set. One pound of 100-grade pectin will \nset a gel with 100 pounds of sugar at the proper pH. \nFruit pectin can be purchased at most grocery stores in liquid or powder form. When using pectin, follow the manufacturers\u2019 instructions for proper set.\nAcid balances the sweetness of the sugar and achieves \nthe pH necessary to set the pectin. Fruits supply some acid, although with berries, additional citric acid is gen -\nerally necessary to balance the jelly to a pH of 2.8 to \n3.3. The most common cause of a jelly failing to set is insufficient acid.\nThe General Procedure  \nfor Making Jam*\nFrom 2 quarts of berries (4\u00bd cups). Makes 4 \npints of jam.\n 1. Wash fruit.\n 2. Heat the fruit to near boiling.\n 3.

Boiling drives off some of the water in the mixture \nand destroys enzymes and microorganisms that would \ndegrade the fruit.\nWine\nWineries may be interested in purchasing local raspber -\nries, as fruit wines and fruit-flavored wines are increasing \nin popularity. The value of wine from a pound of raspberry \ncan be ten times greater than the value of the fresh fruit. \nIn addition, overripe fruit can be used to make raspberry \nwine, so long as the berries are not too moldy. \nTo make raspberry wine, you do not need fancy \nequipment\u2014just a large pot, a fermenting bubbler, wine \nyeast, yeast nutrients, a hydrometer, a 5-gallon glass jug, \nand some cheesecloth. About 30 pounds of berries are required for every 5-gallon batch of wine. Berries are \nvery fruity and acidic, so water and sugar are added \nto the berry pulp prior to fermentation to reduce the acidity to about 0.8% and increase the sweetness. The \nhydrometer is used to measure sugar content and to \nmonitor the fermentation. If the desired alcohol content \nis 10%, then add more sugar to the mix to bring the \nmixture to 20\u00b0 Brix, which is about 20% sugars (2% \nsugar for each 1% alcohol). In general, for every 2 \npounds of berries, add 1 pound of sugar and 1 pound \n(pint) of water. Additional sugar may be required to \nobtain the desired sweetness. A simple rule of thumb is to add 0.1 pound of sugar per gallon of mixture to raise the sugar content by 1\u00b0Brix. At this stage sulfite might be added to prevent oxidation and to eliminate wild yeast. If used, add 50\u2013100 ppm of sulfur dioxide (\u00bc teaspoon of potassium metabisulfite or 3 Campden tables per 5 gallon) and let stand overnight.\nNext add the wine yeast and yeast nutrient. Wine \nyeasts, available from a wine supplier, can tolerate much \nhigher alcohol content than wild yeasts. Dissolve the yeast \nin 100\u00b0F water (use 1 gram of yeast for every 1 gallon of \nliquid), and add it to the fruit-sugar-water mixture. The yeast nutrient is added directly to the mixture. Add the yeast to the mixture within thirty minutes of dissolving \nso a food source is available to the yeast. Also, be sure the \ntemperature difference between the yeast solution and \nthe fruit mixture is no greater than 5\u00b0F, or the yeasts may \nbe killed. Fermentation should occur at 70\u00b0F for about three to four days. This can occur in an open container, and the mixture should be stirred occasionally.\nAfter three days, strain the mixture through cheese -\ncloth and place it into a 5-gallon glass jug fitted with a fermentation bubbler. After another five to ten days, the wine will have reached an alcohol content of about \n10%. When the wine reaches the desired alcohol and \nresidual sugar content, stop the fermentation by placing the wine mixture in a cold room (30\u00b0F) or filtering it. Then decant the mixture and add sulfites (25\u201350 ppm) and sorbate to prevent oxidation and refermentation. \nBerry wine can be allowed to ferment until the alco -\nhol content reaches about 17% assuming that there \nwas enough sugar to reach that level. However, wine \nwith such high alcohol content is rather harsh and will \nrequire a significant amount of sugar to balance the \nalcohol. Stopping the fermentation process at 9% to \n10% is recommended. Typically, wines will be fermented \nto dryness (no residual sugar) and sugar is then added before bottling to adjust the sweetness. Inexpensive kits \nare available to monitor sugar, acid, and alcohol content. \nMonitor sugar content daily, as alcohol increases rapidly \nwhen fermentation occurs at room temperature.\nBerry wines sometimes develop an orange color or \nan off-flavor, but the cause of this is unknown. As with grapes, there may be cultivar differences among berries in their ability to make high-quality wines, but this has not been studied. A mixture of berry cultivars likely will produce better wine than a single cultivar.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 4031, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cda50a5a-418e-4c70-9086-384ac1925985": {"__data__": {"id_": "cda50a5a-418e-4c70-9086-384ac1925985", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b55f22c7-6a1a-43bd-9dce-3b9cb6926ff5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "b008c844ce816cd50f4571d579f1c3c9ba09a60ca16f87a9c7d43a6374512fca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb1809f4-c650-468f-ab51-29002f402df6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "143", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "560cb0b8009d3be9ef04b8802a21abf74f985863eb59f7d1eb7d1dabc650d209", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "However, wine \nwith such high alcohol content is rather harsh and will \nrequire a significant amount of sugar to balance the \nalcohol.

Berries can be dried whole or sliced depending on \nthe final use. If the fruit has a waxy coat, it is necessary \nto \u201ccheck\u201d the skin by dipping in boiling water for 30 \nseconds. Berries are typically dried at 135\u00b0F in dehydra -\ntors that have good air circulation and a thermostat to \ncontrol the temperature. Electric commercial dehydrators \nare common for low volume production but it is possible \nto build one to meet individual needs, as long as food \ngrade materials are used. Forced convection ovens are \nsuitable only if the temperature can be set accurately in \nthe dehydration range (85\u00b0 to 160\u00b0F is desirable). Drying \ntime varies depending on fruit, air humidity, and type of \ndehydrator, and might take up to 20\u201330 hours. Berries \nare dried until leathery. Very acidic fruit will benefit from \nsugar infusion before dehydration. Mix the berries with \na heavy syrup solution and let stand overnight. Drain \nand dehydrate. If better color is desired, fruit can be \ndipped for 5 minutes in an antioxidant solution made with lemon or lime juice (mix 1 cup juice with 1 quart \nwater), ascorbic acid (known as Vitamin C, dissolve \n1 tablespoon in 1 quart water), or commercial mixtures \nsold in supermarkets. Drain well before loading into the \ndehydrator. Dried berries should be stored in hermetic \ncontainers or bags to protect them from ambient moisture. \nFor retail sale, choose an attractive plastic container or bag that allows the consumer to see the product.\nPricing and Labor\nThe price charged for the fruit must be fair to both \nthe grower and the customer. For retailing a specialty \nproduct, price is not determined exclusively by supply \nand demand as it is for commodities. Raspberry and \nblackberry customers often do not shop around for the best price; rather, they develop a loyalty to a particular grower and trust him or her to set a fair price. Fair pric -\ning requires a thorough knowledge of production costs (see \u201cBudgeting,\u201d chapter fourteen). When calculating \ncosts, growers must account for labor, including their \nown. Once production costs are determined, prices can \nbe set that will meet costs and provide a reasonable \nprofit based on consumer\u2019s willingness to pay for the product. Of course, if a \u201cfair\u201d price for you is higher \nthan prevailing market forces, it may not be profitable to grow berries.\nOvercharging can result in disgruntled customers, \nespecially if the perceived value of the farm experience is \npoor, but underpricing can cut deeply into profits. Reduc -\ning prices to undercut the competition may seem like a \ngood idea, but in fact it is likely to cause more harm than \ngood. First, a grower reduces profit by reducing price, \nbecause usually volume does not increase proportionally \n(table 13.1). Then, competitors may lower their prices in \nresponse, thus setting up a price war that can result in growers selling their crops at below break-even prices. \nFinally, customers may expect a drop in price later in \nthe season and hold off buying until then, or expect to \npay a lower price for your product which once again \nreduces profits.\nIn market surveys, individual customers as well as \nwholesale buyers rank quality and consistency above price \nin importance. Individual customers do little comparison \nshopping for produce. Lower-priced produce is often \nconsidered lower quality. The main reason customers visit \na farm market or pick-your-own operations is to obtain fresh fruit and have a pleasant experience\u2014not to get a break on price, especially for a specialty crop with a \nshort season such as bramble fruits. So market forces \nhave less of an impact on the price of direct-marketed raspberries and blackberries than they do on the price of many other commodities.\nIf considering outlets other than PYO, you must \nevaluate your harvest labor options.

Some operations have recruited children or \nsenior citizens to harvest fruit; these workers can perform \nwell if they are treated properly by the grower. Using \nimported labor may be an option for larger operations, \nbut there are numerous state and federal regulations that \naffect this type of employment. Understanding these \nrequirements demands a considerable amount of time \nand expense. Contact your state or province department \nof agriculture and labor for information about hiring \ntemporary help and imported labor. \nMost growers pay pickers piece-work by the pint, \nrather than by the hour. Bonuses offered for a certain \nnumber of pints will provide more incentive. Pickers \nshould be trained to harvest only fruit of good quality \nat the proper stage of ripeness and to properly handle the fruit. Maintaining a good working environment is crucial to keeping good labor. Growers should generate \nenthusiasm for their farm and products and make workers \nfeel like they are part of a team. Workers\u2019 attitudes will show in the quality of the harvested fruit.\nIt is best to start picking as early in the morning as \npossible, provided the fruit is dry, and quit before noon. This will ensure the fruit is picked at its best quality and that pickers are not forced to work during the hottest part of the day.\nAdvertising Basics\nAdvertising is the tool by which potential customers \nare contacted and attracted to your product. Without \nit, customers will never know that you exist. \nFirst Impressions\nCustomers will first judge a farm and grower by the \nadvertising they see. Advertisements should represent \nhow you want the customers to view your operation, \nand they should focus on the entire farm and product \nexperience\u2014not just the price of berries. They should \nbe tasteful and of high quality. The farm should have \nan attractive logo that is displayed prominently in ads, on signs, and on products; it should be simple enough \nto be easily recognized. Communicate with drawings \nrather than words as people may not read long ads. \nContact your state or province department of agriculture \nto place your farm name and address on lists of farms selling berries.Who Are Your Customers?\nIf you do not know who your customers are, you may be advertising to the wrong audience. A customer survey \nis a good way to determine who your customers are. \nAdvertising can then be designed and targeted accord -\ningly. For example, if most of your customers are home -\nmakers with families, then ads should be placed where and when homemakers are likely to see or hear them. \nSurveys show that most customers come from within \n20 miles of a farm. Advertising outside of this area may not pay off. Advertising also should be focused in the densest population areas. \nForms of Advertising\nWord-of-Mouth: The Best Form of Advertising\nThe best form of advertising is the word-of-mouth recom -\nmendation that a satisfied customer passes on to others. \nThis is true for both retail and wholesale customers. \nThe potential benefit from this type of advertising is \nimmense; it will generate lots of customers and many \nof a farm\u2019s best patrons. The quality of the fruit and the \nfarm experience are both part of the perceived value that \nbrings customers back. A bad reputation can develop \nquietly and ruin a business forever.\nTo satisfy a customer and make him or her happy \nenough to recommend a farm to other people, maintain a high-quality product and make buying the product a pleasure.\nRoadside Signs\nRoadside signs are often the first impression custom -\ners get of a farm. Signs should be neat, high-quality, \nattractive, and easy to read. They should represent the \nfarm and farmers.\nSelect the color for signs with care. There should be \nenough contrast between the background and letter -\ning to make the sign easy to read. For example, red or \nblack letters are easy to read against a white background, \nwhile yellow letters are difficult to read. Signs and the letters on them should be large enough to be easily read \nby passing motorists. At 50 mph, a motorist has only \nthree to five seconds to read a sign, so the sign must \nhave only eight words or less to be readable. Symbols \nare often more effective than words.

It is more important to catch the \ncustomers\u2019 attention\u2014let them know what is available and how to get to it. Signs can be effective at directing people to the farm and attracting new customers. Some states have strict rules regarding roadside signs; contact your state department of transportation for details.\nSigns and Advertising\n\u2022 Dark letters on a light background are most legible.\n\u2022 Letters should be 2 inches high for every 10 mph \nof posted speed. For example, if the speed is 40 \nmph, letters should be 8 inches high.\n\u2022 Signs should be at least 100 yards away from the \nentrance to the market for every 10 mph of posted speed.\nDirect Mailings\nOne of the most effective advertising tools is a customer \nmailing list. This provides a direct line of communica -\ntion between customers and \u201ctheir\u201d berry farm. A direct \nmailing sent out at the appropriate time\u2014such as a \npostcard indicating your opening date, the high quality of your fruit, and your desire to see the customer at your farm\u2014gets better results than nearly any other media. \nPostcards are an excellent way to introduce new products, \ncrops, or services; provide an update on events at the \nfarm; and discuss the effects of the season\u2019s weather on the crop. A farm newsletter (electronic or hard copy) is also a good way to give product information, tell farm stories, and educate customers. It is important to make customers feel wanted and a part of the farm.\nTo establish a mailing list, collect the names, postal \naddresses, and email addresses of customers, either when \nthey come to the farm or when they call regarding farm \nproducts. Surveys can be used to collect names for a \nmailing list, ask customers for feedback, and collect \ninformation about the consumers such as what newspaper \nthey read or radio station they listen to. \nThis information can then be used to help focus future advertising. Mailing lists of potential customers in a given \narea may be available for purchase from \nvarious companies. Such lists should be \ntargeted for the region near the farm \nand to the type of customer most likely \nto be interested in your product.The Media\nWhat Should an Ad Say?\nWhen designing an ad, promote benefits, not prices. Do \nnot simply advertise \u201cJones\u2019 Farm\u201d\u2014that is not what \na customer wants to buy. Emphasize the benefits of \nvisiting the farm and the quality, freshness, flavor, and nutritional value of the farm\u2019s products. For pick-your-own operations and retail farm markets, emphasize the \nfun, recreation, and education that a trip to the farm \nprovides. The ad should also give directions, list the \ndays and hours of operation, include a phone number and Web site address, and state whether containers are provided (for PYO operations). Price is a relatively low \npriority among many of today\u2019s consumers. Finally, keep \nads simple, attractive, and recognizable. Most customers \nwill give an ad only a few seconds of attention.\nNewspapers\nMany people read the local newspaper daily, so news -\npapers are a good way to reach customers. Ads should \nbe placed in the newspaper most likely to be read by \npotential customers for your product. Ads should be \nlocated in the section where your clientele is most likely \nto see them, such as the weekly food, marketplace, or \nrecreation section. Ad space is usually sold by the col -\numn inch. A quarter-page ad could cost over $800; but \ndepending on how many people see it, it could be an \neffective, worthwhile investment. Ads should be kept \nshort and simple to prevent losing the customer\u2019s inter -\nest. Photos and logos can grab a reader\u2019s attention and increase the effectiveness of an ad. Offering coupons in an ad can provide further incentive to customers.\nRadio\nRadio is good for creating awareness but may not be \neffective at directing people to the farm if directions \nare complicated. Repetition is the key to radio advertising. It is better to buy \ntwenty spots on one station than one \nspot on twenty stations. The cost of \nradio advertising varies according to \nthe station, audience size, and broadcast \ntime. Stations should be selected on the \nbasis of what your target customers are \nmost likely to listen to.

Consider \na collaborative effort with area growers or your state \nor province organization for growers. The high prices \nmay be cost-effective if a lot of potential customers are \nlikely to be watching. Daytime ads can be effective at \nreaching the homemaker and are much less expensive \nthan primetime ads.\nWorking with the Media\nThe local news media can provide some of the best adver -\ntising at no charge by running a feature story about a \nfarm. Growers should get to know local reporters and give \nthem advance notice about farm activities. Reporters may \nwelcome a public relations story on a berry harvest or a \nlocal jam-making operation. They should be encouraged with an invitation to the farm or a press release promis -\ning good scenes for their cameras. Also consider offering \nan interview to build your operation\u2019s expert image and public relationships. A write up or report by the media \nis free and carries more weight than paid advertising. An \nadvertisement associated with a report will also create \nmore impact.The most important rule when speaking to the media \nabout your farm is\u2014be positive! Has it been rainy this spring? Then the berries will be exceptionally juicy this \nyear. Has it been dry? Then the berries will be smaller but \nsweeter. Everyone likes a winner; no one likes a whiner. \nPromote a quality farm experience in all interactions with \nthe public\u2014through advertising, interviews with the press, \nor one-on-one conversations with the customer.\nTiming and Quantity of Advertising\nAdvertising should be timed around the crop. Light \nadvertising should begin just before the harvest season. Advertising should be heaviest at the beginning of the \nseason, and then taper off as the season progresses. Grow -\ners should not wait for slack sales to begin advertising. \nAs a general rule, pick-your-own advertising should \nbe budgeted at 5% of gross sales (up to 10% for a new operation). Keep records of money spent on advertising \nversus gross sales and number of new customers. Increase \nthe advertising budget if competition in the area is great \nor if the farm location is far from the target audience. \nHowever, do not overdo it\u2014too much advertising lowers \nreturns and may bring in too many customers. Over -\ncrowding and inadequate supplies are sure ways to lose \npatrons. Advertising is the tool that brings customers \nto the farm; the quality and perceived value of the farm experience are what bring them back.\nFurther Reading\nAlltrista Consumer Products. 2004.

However, \nthere are no \u201ctypical\u201d raspberry or blackberry operations. \nEach farm situation has unique characteristics, and the \nprice a grower receives is determined by the mode of \nsale, perceived quality, population demographics, and \nthe availability of fruit in the area. Further, raspberry \nor blackberry plantings usually fill niches in the overall \nfarm operation; rarely is a farm completely dedicated to \nraspberry or blackberry production. Consequently, though \none can develop a budget for an acre of raspberries, the \nfixed costs  (those costs that do not vary with the level \nof production and management, including equipment, \ncoolers, taxes, interest, insurance, and land costs) will vary \ntremendously from farm to farm. These costs should be allocated among the multiple crops on a farm to obtain an accurate enterprise budget.\nThe costs directly associated with the production of \nberries that vary in proportion to acreage or yield are \ncalled variable costs. These are often easier to determine \nfor a given operation than fixed costs. Examples of vari -\nable costs include plants, fertilizer, hours of labor, fuel, and picking containers.\nThe simplest approach to estimating a budget is to \ncalculate the costs of materials and paid labor (variable \ncosts) that are involved in producing and selling the \nberries. Any income remaining after subtracting these \ncosts from sales is considered profit. This method, which \nignores fixed costs, can provide one estimate of profit-\nability for growers who already own the land, tractor, \nsprayer, and cultivation equipment needed for bramble production.\nOne acre of raspberries yields approximately 2,500 \npounds of fruit (this may be higher for summer-  bearing \nraspberry plantings, lower for fall-bearing raspberry plantings). Berries sold pick-your-own may only require \na small amount of off-farm purchases, such as fertil -\nizer and pesticide sprays. If the raspberries are sold for $2.50/pound and the material costs are about $600 per \nyear (table 14.1), one might conclude that raspberries are \nextremely profitable ($6,250 \u2212 $600 = $5,650 per acre). \nHowever, this calculation does not account for four \nkey items: start-up costs, labor costs, marketing costs, \nand fixed costs. Failure to consider these costs greatly \noverestimates profit potential.\nStart-up Costs\nIn the two or three years prior to harvesting the berries, \na grower must invest in site preparation, plants, irrigation, \nand trellis.

An additional year after \nplanting is devoted to plant establishment and includes \nthe large material expense of a trellis system ($1,000 \nper acre or more depending on materials used) (table \n14.4). Since there will be no fruit sold until the fourth \nyear for floricane-fruiting raspberries, these pre-plant, planting, and establishment costs must be covered until \nthe first fruit is sold. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that \nthe sale of the first harvest will exceed the accumulated \ncosts over the first four years; therefore, negative cash \nflow is likely for five or six years until accumulated profit \nexceeds accumulated expenses (figure 14.1).\nLabor Considerations\nTo determine if raspberries are profitable, labor also \nshould be included in the budget\u2014even if the grower/owner does all the work. In the site preparation year, 8.5 \nhours per acre might be spent on the tractor spraying, \nplowing, discing, and seeding. If a \ngrower assumes this labor is worth \n$15/hour, then an additional $130 in \nlabor should be added to the preplant \ncosts (table 14.2). During the plant -\ning and establishment years, three \nvery labor-intensive jobs are planting, \nmulching, weeding, and establishing \na trellis. Although a grower can do \nthese tasks alone, it is much more \nefficient to have at least two helpers, \nand at least one helper is necessary if \na tractor is involved. One can expect \nto spend about 40 hours or more \nof total labor during the two pre-\nharvest years on these specific tasks (tables 14.3 and 14.4).\nIn the fruiting years, a signifi -\ncant amount of labor also is required \nfor harvesting. Even if one sells the \nberries PYO, one has to supervise \nand check customers in and out. For \nPYO, one supervisor can perhaps \noversee 5 acres. In this case, when \ndeveloping the budget, only 1\u20445 of the \nsalary of the supervisor is allocated \nto an individual acre. An alternative \nto PYO is to pay individuals by the \nhalf-pint or pint to harvest the ber -\nries. Paying $0.50\u20130.75 per half-pint \nis typical, so an acre yielding 2,000 \npounds (5,300 half-pints) would cost $2,670 to harvest.

The \npurchase of new or used equipment, such as a tractor or pick-up truck, can be a major contributor to fixed costs. Insurance is a fixed cost. Building a driveway or parking lot can be another major expense. Establishing a water source and irrigation deliver system is a fixed cost. Less \nobvious fixed costs are taxes, utilities, office computer, \nbarn, tractor repairs, and record-keeping expenses. Econo -\nmists also include the interest on capital equipment as an \nexpense (since that money could have been invested in a \nbank and drawing interest) and the cost to rent the land \n(since the grower could have rented the land to someone \nelse as an alternative to growing raspberries).\nThe more acreage one has, generally, the smaller is \neach acre\u2019s share of fixed costs. This is why large farms \noften have greater economies of scale than smaller farms. \nIf the entire cost of an irrigation system, driveway, tractor, \nand barn is borne by just one or two acres of raspberries, \nthen the operation will be less profitable than a farm with \nmore acres, everything else being equal. Of course, one may not be able to expand the operation just to improve \neconomies of scale. Limits may exist in available land, labor, capital, or market that preclude expansion. Rasp -\nberry budgets typically show a profit when only variable \ncosts are considered, but they may be unprofitable when \nall of the fixed costs are included.\nThe tables estimate costs for a five-acre raspberry \nplanting on a per-acre basis. An attempt is made to \nestimate fixed costs for various pieces of equipment, \nassuming they are used for other farm operations besides \nraspberries. Equipment used only on raspberries (e.g., \nan air-blast sprayer) will have a higher fixed cost than equipment that is used for many different crops (e.g., a tractor). The fixed cost of using a sprayer for a particular \noperation includes both the fixed cost of the tractor \nper hour, plus the fixed cost of the sprayer per hour, \nmultiplied by the number of hours required to spray \nthe acre of berries.\nFor budgeting purposes, the cost of capital equipment \nis not deducted from income in the year it is purchased, rather it is depreciated over the life of the equipment. \nFor example, if a tractor is purchased \nfor $30,000 and is expected to have \na 30-year life, then only $1,000 is \ndeducted from income in any one \nyear for this purchase. If the tractor is \nused on 10 acres of crops, then only $100 of fixed costs are allocated to \neach acre in each year. (If the money \nwas borrowed to purchase the trac -\ntor, then these interest payments also \nmust be allocated proportionately.)\nIt is more accurate to calculate \nfixed costs on a per-hour basis, rather \nthan a per-acre basis, because this \nallows the grower to allocate fixed \ncosts depending on how much \nequipment use each acre requires. \nFor example, if the tractor is used \nfor 500 hours each year on various \nfarm operations, the fixed cost for \nthe tractor is then $2/hour.

On large farms, overhead costs can be in the range of $500 per acre. On smaller farms that only grow raspberries, the overhead per acre can be very high, perhaps in the thousands of dollars.\nMarketing and Distribution Costs\nAlthough word-of-mouth is the best form of advertising, \nit does not happen instantaneously and without some \ninitial investment of time and money. For PYO, a grower \noften will have to advertise, at least during the first few \nyears when the operation is becoming known in the \ncommunity. In addition, the grower may want to have \na picnic area, a few farm animals, or other attractions \nto aid in marketing the farm, and these all cost money to develop and maintain.\nFor sales to supermarkets or farm markets, a grower \nmust transport the fruit and perhaps pay someone to \nattend to the farm market. Again, these costs should be \nincluded in the budget. Because of the extreme variability \nfrom farm to farm in these costs, they have not been \nincluded in the representative budget.\nConsiderations for \nMultiple-Year Budgeting\nWhen developing budgets for a long period of time, such \nas ten years, some economists make an adjustment to \nfuture income (discounting future dollars) so the total \nprofit in future years is expressed in today\u2019s dollars. A $2,000 profit today is worth more than a $2,000 profit \nten years from now because of inflation. A common \npercentage for discounting future dollars is 6% annu -\nally. The sum of adjusted profit dollars over a period of years is called \u201cnet present value\u201d and is a good measure of profitability.\nThe net present value must be positive for an opera -\ntion to be considered profitable. Even if the net present \nvalue is positive, a raspberry planting still may not be \nfeasible if a grower cannot obtain the money necessary to establish the planting. If the grower can obtain the \nmoney for establishing the planting, they may not be in a positive cash flow situation for several years. For \nraspberries, most growers see a positive cash flow near year six (figure 14.1). The grower-investor must be able \nto function without any net return on investment for \nthis period of time.\nPutting It All Together\nTo construct a budget, list all of the operations for each year, from the preplant year through year ten. Then list the variable costs required to do those tasks (materials, \nlabor, and fuel). Try to estimate the fixed costs associated \nwith each step. This can be difficult when equipment is \nused for tasks other than raspberries. (Refer to tables 14.2 \nthrough 14.5 as an example of an enterprise budget for an acre of summer raspberries which is part of a larger farm in the Northeast.) Then include the costs associ -\nated with harvesting and marketing the berries. Lastly, include an estimate of overhead costs.\nOnce the total costs are known, estimated yields and \nprices can be used to determine profitability over time. A worthwhile exercise after calculating your operating \nbudget is to determine the break-even price point. If \nthe operation is profitable, the break-even price will be \nlower than the retail price for the berries. This difference \nindicates how much flexibility there can be in pricing, and guides in determining volume discounts.\nDeveloping budgets also means making assump -\ntions, including the assumption that the weather will \ncooperate, yields will be somewhat predictable, and no \nmajor pest outbreaks will occur. Some economists argue \nthat although certain farming operations are profitable, the risk/profit ratio is too high in agriculture to attract investment. One might be better off investing money in a bank at a given interest rate, than to invest in farming \nat a similar interest rate but higher risk. If one must \nborrow money for agriculture, it will be important to \nconvince the banker that you know these risks and can adjust to them.\nTable 14.6 summarizes expenses in a production year \nby incorporating the cost scenario from the previous \ntables.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4380, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a620159c-6e5a-4459-85eb-75a68b0e58e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "a620159c-6e5a-4459-85eb-75a68b0e58e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "152", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "54ca2be5-e656-4ef2-a4e7-b22dcaeb2edc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "152", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "4c7db3636493599f33955dd5f7e98606cc8d00b49b3e32de2aae78e17d8957c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b65adbc-c054-4e48-bb27-7b5622f0066e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "152", "file_name": "Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Daanish Uddin Khan\\OneDrive\\Documents\\GitHub\\Pandas\\data\\blackberry\\Raspberry-and-Blackberry-Production-Guide.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4475708, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "6581001cc93c8a772c73a4e65ec324d5a0b7c35a74b610b5fe66ed880e82a785", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If \nthe operation is profitable, the break-even price will be \nlower than the retail price for the berries.

A PYO operation would have lower \nharvest costs, but the value of fruit would be less ($5,400 \n= 2,000 pounds \u00d7 $2.70/pound or $1.00 per half-pint), \nrealizing a smaller profit. With these assumptions, the \n\u201cbreak-even\u201d price for the commercially sold fruit would \nbe $1.12 a half-pint, and $1.60/pound for PYO. Of \ncourse, a grower wants to make money rather than just break even. Assuming the start-up costs ($6,700) plus the fruiting year costs ($1,500) were invested in a bank \ndrawing interest at 5%, one would receive a payment \nof $410 for doing nothing. So a grower would want to return at least this amount for all of the work, invest -\nment, and risk associated with the enterprise.Detailed production costs have been developed for \nblackberries in the Southeast. The total cost of producing, \nharvesting, and marketing blackberries was estimated to \nbe $15,514 per acre with a 10,000-pound-per-acre yield \nin the second year of production. Labor was the greatest \nexpense category ($13,739), comprising 70% of total \ncosts. Given certain assumptions about price and yield, \na positive return on investment of about $3,900 per acre \nwas realized once plants were in full production. Start-up \ncosts were covered after five years, and revenues were \npositive after this time. Accumulated net cash flow after \nten years was about $19,670. Break-even PYO prices \nranged from $1.15 to $1.35/pound for yields of 12,000 to 8,500 pounds per acre, and $2.00 to $3.00/pound for wholesaling those same yields.\nThis analysis took into account many factors that \ngrowers often overlook. For example, the farmer was \npaid $16.39/hour, went to an annual meeting, subscribed \nto an Internet service, and budgeted for farm overhead and interest on investment. \nTo summarize, generally raspberries and blackberries \nhave a high profit potential provided that fixed costs are \nnot too high. Although yields are relatively low compared \nto some other crops, the price per pound is very high, \nparticularly for ready-picked berries and those produced \nout-of-season. Gross sales of $8,000\u2013$12,000 per acre are \nnot unreasonable for raspberries, and up to $25,000 per acre for blackberries. Berries already harvested tend to provide a higher profit than PYO berries, provided that the grower can find harvest labor. Establishment costs can approach $7,000\u2013$12,000, and a positive cash flow usually does not occur until the third or fourth fruiting \nyear. If a grower has an aptitude for marketing and if \nlabor is available, then raspberry and blackberry produc -\ntion can be a very successful agricultural endeavor.Table 14.6  Summary of total expenses and \nincome per acre during full production \nfor a summer raspberry field that is part \nof a large fruit farm in the Northeast.\nExpense Commercial PYO\nVariable costs $1,430 $1,430\nFixed costs  $70  $70\nHarvest cost $2,670 $230\nHarvest containers  $400 $0 \nAdvertising  $200  $300\n10% portion of \nstart-up costs$670 $670\nOverhead $500 $500\nTotal Expense $5,940 $3,200\nIncome $10,600 $5,400\nProfit $4,660 $2,200\nFurther Reading\nSafley, C.D., O.

NRAES is sponsored by eleven land grant universities in the eastern United States. We receive \nadministrative support from Cornell University, the host university.\nWhen you buy books from NRAES, you are helping to improve the accessibility of land grant university \nknowledge. While 15% of NRAES\u2019 annual income is provided by member universities, the funds to publish new books and coordinate new conferences come from our customers through book sales, conference registrations, and occasional project-specific grants.\nNRAES publishes practical books of interest to fruit and vegetable growers, landscapers, dairy and livestock \nproducers, natural resource managers, SWCD (soil and water conservation district) staff, consumers, landowners, and \nprofessionals interested in agricultural waste management and composting. NRAES books are used in cooperative extension programs, in college courses, as management guides, and for self-directed learning.\nNRAES publishes two types of books: peer-reviewed books and conference proceedings. Our peer-reviewed \nbooks are evaluated prior to publication for technical accuracy and usefulness to the intended audience. The reviewers \nmay include university faculty, extension educators, potential users, and interested persons from government and agribusiness. Conference proceedings are not peer-reviewed. However, the authors of papers presented at NRAES-sponsored conferences are chosen for their recognized expertise.
